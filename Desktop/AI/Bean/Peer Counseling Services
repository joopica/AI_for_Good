The Sexual Assault Centre of the McGill Students’ Society (SACOMSS) is a volunteer-run organization committed to supporting survivors of sexual assault and their allies through direct support, advocacy, and outreach. SACOMSS’ Support Groups program provides a safe space for ongoing healing and empowerment of survivors of the English-speaking Montreal community. Meetings are confidential and free-of-charge. Three to ten members meet weekly with two trained co-facilitators, in a physically accessible, confidential location near McGill’s downtown campus. Since participation is open-ended, you are never forced to attend a set number of sessions. Each group will develop its own guidelines to protect everyone’s emotional safety and maintain respect for one another. From week to week, members determine the direction of discussion. You will never be judged. Through sharing, listening, and encouragement, you will both give and receive emotional support.

To help you transition to your life in Montreal and McGill, the Buddy Program connects new international students with returning students. They provide the friendly face, helping hand, and first Montreal friendship that can make a world of difference for new arrivals. Buddies can also offer linguistic support, cultural guidance and information about life at McGill.

full_desc vent over tea is a free active listening service that pairs people who need to vent with an empathetic listener to chat in a local coffee shop. Based in Montreal and founded in April 2015 by McGill psychology graduates, our goal is to provide a casual, confidential and non-judgmental outlet for members of our community. Our program is based on studies that have shown the benefits derived from expressing one's self to a compassionate listener. We do not offer counselling, psychotherapy or advice. We provide you with a listening ear and a safe space to vent. We developped a unique training program with Stephane Bensoussan, holistic health and educational psychologist and director of PsySanté, that teaches our listeners how to actively listen and guide the conversation in a meaningful and empathetic way. Our volunteers can help you work through your problems by asking reflective questions and showing empathetic regard. All you need to do is select an available time and a coffee shop that you would like to meet in. One of our friendly volunteers will meet you there.

We are a SSMU service, meaning we operate under the umbrella of the McGill Student Union.

Advocacy Branch volunteers are trained to assist and support individuals who are interested in reporting sexual violence at McGill or filing a complaint under a McGill policy. In addition, they are knowledgeable about support and accommodations that are available.

	O-SVRSE
Operated by full time staff, including professional social workers. They offer crisis intervention, short term crisis counseling, referrals, survivor support activities, support groups, reporting information, and accompaniment. They are an office within McGill University under the Office of the Dean of Students.

McGill Students’ Nightline is a confidential, anonymous, and non-judgmental listening service run by McGill students. We aim to provide the community with a variety of support, which includes anything from information to crisis management and referrals. We are an English service.

We are an information and referral service.
We are here to help you find the answer to pretty much any question you can think of. Whether you need directions, are wondering about an academic policy, or want to know how to bake lasagna, we can help you out! Additionally, we can offer referrals to a multitude of McGill and Montreal services. Feel free to ask us for anything from a pizza delivery number to a Montreal drop-in clinic.

We are an active listening service.
Sometimes friends give too much advice, sometimes you might feel uncomfortable talking to those around you, and sometimes you really just want something to be kept confidential. That’s okay, and that’s why we’re here! If you’re stressed out about school, or maybe you find yourself really missing home, give us a call—we’re here to listen and help you work through whatever you’re feeling.

We are trained in crisis management.
A crisis is any situation where you feel overwhelmed and may not know what to do. Some examples include a sudden loss in your life, an uncomfortable drug trip, and sexual assault. Please give us a call if you ever experience anything that feels out of your control. We’re here to support you, no matter what life might throw your way.
