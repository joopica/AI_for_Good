0,bwid8m,"it should be fine, there's never an ""end of therapy"" where they don't let you come back or smth lmao"
1,bwid8m,"I contacted PsyMontreal through McGill who set me up with the first therapist I’ve actually found helpful. McGill covers about 5 sessions per year, which isn’t a lot, but it’s something. Otherwise, it’s about $100 a session"
2,bwid8m,"If you’re an international student, you can get 80% refund on therapist sessions up to 750$ a year with IHI (not much I know - although some therapists will lower their prices if you talk to them about it, but don’t expect high quality for low price). 

I find that a good therapist will keep the conversation interesting. If they don’t - trash them. It’s no use talking to an uninterested wall anyways. Mcgill counselling is nonsense - they’re just there to prevent shooters hehe"
3,bwid8m,second this! I actually used to see someone there and want to go back. Is there a particular therapist you recommend?
4,biwtym,"Yes, they are."
5,biwtym,"I've been told that counselling does continue through the summer, I plan on taking advantage of it myself. Might be reduced hours though."
6,biwtym,"Counselling is open and according to the counsellor I've been seeing, they get less busy in the summer because there are far less people here. Can't say for sure how accurate that is though bc this will be my first summer using their services."
7,b1cbg4,"At the risk of giving an unpopular opinion (I welcome the downvotes!), if one is feeling suicidal and this is directly connected to one's academic experience or stress from school, this individual should leave school immediately and receive proper medical attention and help. There are many students who are under the same stress and pressure (if not more) and are not suicidal, so there are likely underlying reasons and causes that need immediate attention that have nothing to do with school or McGill. I don't think a deferral solves those issues. Now, there is a pretty big leap from ""suicide attempt"" to feeling exam stress and crying. I have a hard time empathizing with individuals who pathologize normal emotions like exam stress/anxiety or crying. When I am stressed about exams I ask myself why. Am I stressed because I did not effectively manage my time so now I am behind and am most likely going to be obliterated by the final? Am I stressed because I incline toward magnifying exams to be something grander that what they really are, even though I am totally prepared and just need to put in the time? Am I stressed because I am comparing myself to others, and in my own perception everyone appears better than me, no matter how hard I work? Am I stressed because I experience the horror of the world as I scroll through my Facebook (rather than focusing on the infinite beauty that can be seen in a rain drop off the wing of a butterfly)? Am I suffering from a depression that is becoming more severe and unmanageable and school is making it worse because I am not able to focus on my mental health in a way to begin rebuilding my psyche? etc etc etc. But the long short of it...the moment the word suicide is brought up, the individual needs to leave school immediately and get help. To use it as an attempt to defer an exam...that sounds like another kind of pathology. Again, sorry about the unwelcome opinion. Confirmation bias helps nobody."
8,b1cbg4,"Mental health isn’t usually treated that well in the states, but a mental health crisis is just as important to treat as a physical health crisis. If you’re having mental problems: see a professional. Not only will they provide you with assistance (usually), but they’ll provide you with undeniable documentation that you need for protocol-friendly authorities (teachers). If you don’t have documentation, you’re leaving the extension call to the will/trust of the teacher. Wish you luck. Get help if you need it. "
9,b1cbg4,"I was able to get a final exam deferral last semester due to stress induced insomnia. I literally couldn’t sleep for more than 2 hours at a given time because of how much my mind felt like I needed to be working. Every 2 hours, I’d wake up, wired, thinking I needed to work, and couldn’t go back to sleep. I went to the clinic the day of my exam, waited 4-5 hours, got a doctor’s note and my exam deferred. "
10,b1cbg4,"Yes, there are so many things you can do. I wish I knew more about my options earlier. Firstly, if you are in immediate crisis, having suicidal plans go to the ER. You can also go to the McGill clinic and talk to a doctor, they can give you a medical note and refer you to psychiatric services if needed, the only thing is that psychiatric services have a pretty long wait so if you have options elsewhere take them. Then go to Counselling services. They have crisis walk in hours and you can also call to make an appointment.  
Another incredibly important resource is the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD). They can help you communicate with your professors, help you with exam accommodations etc. To me the most helpful part of the OSD was having a contact there, so when I was having a crisis I knew who to call first and they would help me see the steps I needed to take to move forward.  
"
11,b1cbg4,"yes! it is an absolutely valid reason! don't invalidate your situation – would you say the same thing to someone who had a broken leg? or pneumonia? a mental health crisis is every bit as valid. 

you'll need to get a letter from a psychologist/psychiatrist/physician (who i hope you are seeing already) explaining that you're suffering from great personal distress etc., but it's 100% a valid reason. you should also consider getting a referral from your mental health professional to write your exams with the OSD. they won't help for a deferral or extension but they will try to accommodate any issues that may arise while writing an exam.

i hope things get better. please take care of yourself <3 "
12,b1cbg4,Yes. Just need a note or other documentation.
13,b1cbg4,following
14,b1cbg4,"This is a valid argument but I'd like to disagree and explain why. Some mental health conditions are chronic, so even if you drop everything and focus on your mental health you never know when it's going to come back in full swing. In fact needing to drop all your classes because you are having a breakdown, loosing all the hard work you did prior in the semester, is very harsh.   


And yes of course there is a difference between being stressed for an exam and that stress affecting you so badly that you cannot function for days on end and suicide attempts are of course a very large leap from that, but for someone who has an illness, it's not that wild of a leap. But your line about there being students with more pressure on them not feeling that way is a dangerous thing to say. I didn't get help for years because I kept thinking that I didn't have the right to be depressed. My life was great, I shouldn't be allowed to feel this way. I felt so much shame, I bottled it in, and I had a complete crash at one point, planning to end my life, but I still felt that I didn't deserve help, because I had no right to feel this way. Luckily for me, people close to me realized what was going on and I was rushed to the ER. So please think twice before you say something like that again.

&#x200B;

I've gotten a lot of help, but there are no underlying problems in my past that explain away my depression. It's probably partly genetic, when I opened up about it I found out that about half my extended family is dealing with some form of depression or related mental illness. There is a chance that I will need to be on medication my entire life (I'm hoping not), but medication is also unpredictable, it can suddenly stop working the same way, my mental health can take a turn, and stress and physical illness can actually be triggers for things like that. So all the wonderful help that I am getting from the university and the health care system, is essential for me to finish my degree.  


Some people would argue that people with chronic mental conditions that affect their academic life just shouldn't get higher education. I hope I don't need to explain why that's an awful opinion to have."
15,b1cbg4,"I’m probably going to hell for agreeing with you, but at the risk of ALSO sounding like a dick, I always cringe a little when I see folks on this sub or elsewhere having full-blown breakdowns over this kind of stuff. It’s a fucking school exam, come on, not a cancer diagnosis— the world won’t end if you do poorly, or even if you fail.  I know a lot of people have legitimate mental health issues and need treatment, and I don’t normally like playing Suffering Olympics, but Christ on a cracker, let’s have some maturity and perspective. 

I also have to wonder how much of it is performative in a way and egged on by other students— if you’re not on the verge of mental collapse, clearly you’re not working hard enough. "
16,b1cbg4,"This  is a reasonable opinion for the most part, but to clarify I'm not talking about people crying due to exam stress, I'm talking about someone manically sobbing to the point that they can't sleep or function for days on end. I've witnessed this kind of crippling stress in people before and I agree maybe they  should be away  from school seeking psychiatric help for what is likely a deeper rooted issue, but it hardly seems reasonable to put humans through such pain and suffering for an exam without giving them an honest chance at redeeming themselves. I guess this overall question just stems from my  perception of academia being quite unmerciful and causing a lot of suffering and stress in young people that just seems so unwarranted, as so many of us will look at an individual exam as being detrimental to our possibility of being successful or happy in life."
17,b1cbg4,">There is a chance that I will need to be on medication my entire life (I'm hoping not)

I've never understood this, especially when it comes to medications like SSRIs and SNRIs (which can take up to a month to work properly). If you don't think you need your medication anymore, that means the drugs are *working.* Going off them can actually cause a severe relapse in mental health, and when you get back on them afterwards, it might never work the same for you again. 

There is a huge societal push to get off medications, and I've had shitty psychologists make that their end goal. However, it can be dangerous to do so, especially if you have a family history of depression and mental illness. 

When I went off medication because of that societal cue, it royally fucked me up. I couldn't take the old medication anymore, and it took two more medications to find one that worked again. That was three months of CEGEP I couldn't get back, and it made getting into McGill much harder. 

I'm fine now, but I would warn anyone on long term medication to only change it under the supervision of a psychiatrist, not based off of personal feelings. "
18,awi1f8,"Just out of curiosity, what was the reason for the denial? I haven’t experienced any issues with the coverage. "
19,awi1f8,Same here 
20,awi1f8,"Basically I tried out BetterHelp since it's prohibitively expensive to get in person counselling. When I called Studentcare and explained I would be getting e-counselling from a US provider, they said it would be covered as long as the service is provided in English and provided I include the licence number of the practitioner. 

But when I submitted my claim, I got denied since in the US they have a LPC (licensed professional counselor) but that's not recognized in Canada or by Desjardins. So now, I'm out +$200 and in the process of complaining. I mean if you are going to provide incomplete info on the phone and then blame me for acting on it...what can I say?"
21,awi1f8,"Not so much the denial of coverage, it's their lack of oversight or complaints evaluation that worries me.

Other than Studentcare, no one else can intervene or appeal their decisions at the moment. On their complaints page, the 1st step is to contact ASEQ (Studentcare's parent company?). After 2 calls, lasting an hour each, I was told I would be called back by a supervisor - didn't happen after either call. Had to call a 3rd time, about a month later to follow up, finally managed to get a hold of a supervisor. Didn't help though, claiming it's Desjardin who makes the claims decisions.

 Then the 2nd step of the complaints process is to contact Desjardins - but they just say they can't handle student coverage. Desjardins redirects the call directly to ASEQ. Voila - the infinite bureaucratic loop. 

The 3rd final step is to contact the regulating body of brokerage and financial companies in Quebec (autorité des marchés financiers). After reaching out to them, I was told to submit an official written complaint with both Desjardins (the actual insurance provider) and ASEQ (the brokerage company). Now, I'm waiting for them to get back to me. "
22,avnvl4,"You should definitely seek help at the clinic! They offer drop-in appointments, and if you come in the morning (go to the Brown Building around 8:30, their offices are on the fourth floor) it's very possible you can set up a same day appointment. You can also call mental health services at (514) 398-3601 and set up an appointment over the phone. The people working there are incredibly kind and helpful and I'm sure you could get an appointment in the very near future and meet with a counselor.

&#x200B;

If you need anything else, feel free to send me a pm! Good luck and stay strong :)

edit: wrong floor"
23,avnvl4,"Services are (for the most part) not bad, just hard to access. There's big waiting lists and few options if you can't wait besides going to a private practice somewhere. That being said, if you can wait, or if you happen to get lucky with your timing, it's pretty decent quality help."
24,avnvl4,"If you’re starting to lose it, it means it is urgent!! Get help, try the clinic! It’s better than doing nothing!! Good luck!

Edit: word choice"
25,avnvl4,"If you're new to counselling services, they do same-day drop ins. They start offering them at 10am and you gotta be quick, but it's possible. The drop in appointments are 30mins, and after you and your counselor will discuss a plan. Empower me also offers free short-term counselling if you call their number (it's not over the phone, you call to schedule)."
26,avnvl4,ive had better luck actually being hospitalized than with mcgill psych. in my opinion they're unorganized and rely purely on medication. or go private if your insurance covers it...
27,avnvl4,"i totally agree that the biggest problem is accessibility. in a situation where you need immediate help you should go elsewhere – even try the ER if things get really bad. but if that's not the case the clinic is absolutely worth it. 

if you get to the clinic right as they open you might get a drop in slot otherwise it's like ~1 month wait to get an appointment."
28,avnvl4,Thank you so much for your reply!!! You guys are so kind I wanna cry😭😭😭 
29,avnvl4,"You just have to be direct with what you want to get out of the drop in appointment. I went in and clearly stated that i would like to get a referral to psychiatric services. I got it, and ended up with an appointment a week later (much earlier than expected). 
As long as you go in with an idea of how you want to handle your mental state (CBT, medication, group therapy, etc), they will help you get what you want and need."
30,avnvl4,Yeah the waiting list is one of my biggest worries... Thanks for your reply tho!!
31,avnvl4,Thanks for your kind words!! 
32,avnvl4,Ohh I didn’t know that there’s a drop in slot! Thank you so much!
33,avnvl4,"For sure! If you are feeling like you should reach out for help, there’s no reason to hesitate. Hopefully everything works out and you get a spot in the very near future at the clinic (which is totally doable!) 😊"
34,avnvl4,😫😫😫😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏!!!
35,akvvu2,Doesn't mean much if they don't actually increase the number of staff - you won't have to walk between buildings but you'll still have to wait weeks for an appointment.
36,akvvu2,"i'll believe it when i fuckin see it
mcgill mental health services has done nothing but make my mental health worse"
37,akvvu2,"Right when I'm graduating, god damn. Regardless, cheers McGill, it's overdue."
38,akvvu2,With a $14 million budget I sure hope the plan includes more staff positions 
39,akvvu2,perhaps it would help your mental health not to look at everything in the most negative way possible
40,akvvu2,You would think...except there's no mention of any new staff in the article
41,akvvu2,"That's a smarmy attitude to have when McGill's mental health support is well known as historically shitty. For example...

Last term I was having a crisis and I needed an appointment, and I booked one... Only problem is that the earliest appointment was going to happen a month and a half from then. 

It was a joke. 

There's a time to be optimistic, and there's a time to have a smidgen of sympathy for the students who try to get help but are unable to obtain appointments. 

"
42,akvvu2,being angry at an institution that has literally caused me repeated harm is not looking at *everything* in the most negative way possible but ok you do you dude
43,akvvu2,It should -- I was on a student consulting meeting and it was mentioned 
44,akvvu2,"Is it sympathy to assist someone in a counter productive, negative view? I don't think so.

The service may be shit, that's not what I'm talking about. The problem is that complaining about it (like any other complaining) is destructive on a personal level. You can justify complaints with facts about the shitty service but that doesn't justify maintaining what is essentially a bad attitude for yourself.

But obviously none of you will accept this."
45,akvvu2,[deleted]
46,akvvu2,"Complaining about the apallingly crappy mental health network at Mcgill is productive. If people don't give feedback (esp. Negative feedback) the mental health system at McGill will never change. That's why people don't accept your faulty logic. Finally, there's no reason to believe that we ""essentially have bad attitudes about ourselves"" from what we posted. Get a grip. "
47,akvvu2,"so if you regard complaining is a toxic behaviour, what does complaining about people making *totally justified* complaints say about you? 

i know that mcgill loves to invalidate peoples feelings/experiences – especially surrounding mental health – but it's so nice to see that they're teaching it to their students too!"
48,akvvu2,"you should add your constructive criticism and awareness of these issues to this thread too 
https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/alix9x/mcgill_cares_about_mental_health/"
49,akvvu2,"What do you think ""agency"" entails here? What's better than going to seek out the professional help that McGill claims to provide? "
50,akvvu2,"You are right, those complaints will (eventually) produce change. But at the expense of having a subreddit full of complaints which is bad for the individual. I can't assume you have a bad attitude in life from this only experience, but the subreddit in general have a bad attitude because it is extensively used as a place to complain."
51,akvvu2,"I'm not trying to invalidate your feelings friend, I'm trying to make you get rid of your negative ones. Anyone is free to choose to react to something (like this progress toward more wellness services) in a positive or negative ways. This internal game has no impact on the progress of the institution but has great impact on your attitude and well being."
52,alix9x,"I tried to book an appointment with counselling today, they told me the earliest they would see me is end of March. "
53,alix9x,Same. It sucks. 
54,alix9x,"I suggest you use the nightline. It's easy to access, and it is nice to talk to someone who is not judgemental"
55,alix9x,"you need to try for a drop-in appointment! if you go after 10am but not too long after, you can get a quick appointment and then they tell you what your options are. the clinician i saw was completely booked up for months, but she has a few teaching students working toward their masters who have lots of availabilities so now i see one of her students weekly."
56,alix9x,"Unfortunately this is standard wait time for free counseling programs in QC :(

My friend had to wait 6 months for therapy after a 72hour hold at the hospital.

Your best bet is to get on the waitlist, even if it's lo ng, and look into private sliding scale counseling/therapy. SSMU insurance covers 80% per visit up to 500$/year.

Also working on CBT skills independently (books, worksheets, apps) and making sure your meds are working well for you if you're taking any."
57,alix9x,"Without being trained in the field, and so giving advice only based on personal experience: CBT is a good idea. OP, it means Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. There's a book that helped me as a student called Get Out of Your Mind & Into Your Life, by Steven C. Hayes. This follows an ACT approach (Acceptance & Commitment Therapy), which is a realm of self-inquiry within CBT methodology. Don't be intimidated by these words-- you won't have to Accept or Cognitively Behave in any wild way. If anything, these are tools that help you be more \*you\*.  You should still talk to a counselor whenever possible. It always helps in ways one doesn't expect, to talk out problems (even embarrassing ones) with someone who will listen and not respond in any way they know won't help the matter."
58,alix9x,"Not op but thank you for the book recommendation :)

I haven't done ACT so the book sounds like a good starting point."
59,al2ubd,"Hi, I also experienced problems with my counsellor, they told me I had to fill in this Feedback Form and then I was transferred to another counsellor. Here is the link: [https://mcgill.ca/counselling/feedback](https://mcgill.ca/counselling/feedback)

That's great of you to realize this and decide to request a change. The first counsellor that I saw was this rude, disinterested man who did not take me seriously and it took me a while to realize that this was not okay and that I deserved to get the help I needed, then I made a request to switch to a female counsellor who was part of the PRIDE team. Good luck!"
60,al2ubd,"High key McGill's mental health resources range from pathetic to piss-poor. Expect nothing, and it'll still be deeply disappointing. If your issue is pressing, do not rely on McGill's health resources. "
61,al2ubd,"You can request someone else if you find after a while that it's not working out for you, but also remember to give them a chance. You've had one single meeting. If you were expecting every topic to be addressed in a single session, then your expectations were unrealistic. Counselling takes time, and problems need to be worked through. It's a process, not a quick fix, and you can't ""tackle"" everything at once. Meet with him/her a few more times and see what happens. If you're still not happy, you can always request a change. "
62,al2ubd,"Protip, don't use any of McGill's services for anything serious."
63,al2ubd,thank u so much! that's my preference also that i didn't get to specify before the first meeting 
64,al2ubd,"by tackle i mean just acknowledge or mention even, and that's the thing i would meet with her if she'd allowed me but she just told me that she'll sign me up for a workshop and send me to her \~ intern to talk...she made it very clear that she wasn't interested in seeing me again even when i explicitly stated and repeated that i'd like to continue counselling (to which she just went like why,,?) "
65,al2ubd,The best tips are always found in the comments.
66,al2ubd,"The intern thing is pretty standard for McGill unfortunately. They don't have the resources for enough people, my counselor tried to dissuade me from even seeing an intern saying they couldn't talk to everyone who was a little sad (was being treated for anxiety and depression lmao). Fwiw I had pretty good experiences with the interns. They are way less jaded than the primary counselors. "
67,a6iu1j,"Message me! I went through something similar. Also graduate school is more focused on your last two years (and depending on your faculty, your research experience) my GPA was much lower than a 2.8 after second year and I still have how's of graduate school!"
68,a6iu1j,"I do think getting mental health help could be really beneficial for you. This doesn't sound like fun situation at all. Mental health problems can evolve into physical health problems if they're not addressed early enough. You should also be proud of achieving a 2.8 despite what you've been going through. 

Many graduate schools will only look at your GPA for your last two years of study, so since you are a second year, you still have room for improvement!

How many classes are you taking? I would drop your course load down to 4 classes/semester (12 credits). You can then do an extra semester and graduate half a year later, but with much better grades and mental health! Doing so will still keep you a full time student. If your parents are not too understanding of mental health struggles, you can say that you are doing this to increase your GPA for graduate school applications, which wouldn't be wrong.

For the insomnia, I would look into ""sleep hygiene"", see this [handout](https://www.anxietycanada.com/sites/default/files/SleepHygiene.pdf). This is the first action a doctor will recommend, so you might as well try it before you see one. Otherwise, we now have options for sleep medications that aren't addictive.

For the mental health problems, I would go to a walk-in clinic (I assume you don't have a family doctor as an international student?) so they can refer you to the appropriate resources. I also recommend you take advantage of the free counselling services at McGill. Right now there will be a longer wait list, but it's better to be on a long waitlist than on no waitlist at all!

For counselling in the meantime, I recommend looking up ""sliding scale psychotherapy"" in Montreal. These places charge you according to income, so they won't charge you as much as a student. Additionally, [SSMU health insurance covers 500$ of therapy per year](http://www.studentcare.ca/rte/en/McGillUniversityundergraduatestudentsSSMU_Health_HealthCoverage_HealthPractitioners_Psychologists), covering 80% each visit. This means that even a 100$ appointment would only cost you 20$, and you could get 6 sessions covered."
69,a6iu1j,"If you’re feeling suicidal definitely reach out to a close friend/family member or trained professional. 

You still have a LOT of time to make up for your GPA, but even if you don’t, no worries. There are many paths to success, and there’s a lot more if you at least finish the degree, so don’t think about dropping out because of a subpar GPA."
70,a6iu1j,which program are u in? I’m in Phil major and i don’t know what i can do without graduate school degree..
71,a6iu1j,"Im a Philosophy major who finished his degree just a few days ago. First, I want to stress what u/sprainedanklee  pointed out: graduate school focuses mostly on your last two years. You are expected to adjust to the requirements of the program at first, and later excel. For instance, I was below a 3.0 after my first year, and now im graduating north of 3.5. You WILL get better grades if you adequately adjust, go talk to your professors during their office hours, and put in the required time for the assessments. In fact, I suggest starting assignments the day you get the instructions in order to (i) relieve any anxiety, (ii) discuss your topic with your professor, and (iii) edit and revise. That always worked for me. I strongly suggest talking to the professors in the department - as in my experience they are very approachable - as well as familiarizing yourself with the mental health resources on campus. Should you have any specific questions, please feel free to message me...Lastly, try to not focus too much on what will happen in a few years - such as graduate school - and rather focus on what will happen in the immediate future: the courses you are taking. Only by doing well now can you set yourself up to do well later. Take it a day at a time."
72,a6iu1j,"I'm in CS/bio. I'm not very familiar with philosophy but I would do some googling! From what I can tell if you can show that you have the critical thinking skills one would expect to gain in a philosophy major, you could go towards working in the government or various administrative jobs, maybe journalism, maybe therapy? I think for those a combination of graduate school/alternative schooling/some experience would be necessary, but your undergrad is a good start!! "
73,9zqpbw,"I went to counselling last year and it was pretty good for being free actually. Some of the counsellors are psyc graduate students and don’t have that much experience but they are helpful. I was going to counselling for more light-hearted stuff and didn’t need any medication. I had Aislinn and quite liked her actually, but she is one of the younger and prob less experienced ones. Your first appointment is with the supervisor and  I’m guessing depending on how severe the case is she matches you with someone that is experienced enough to fit your needs. "
74,9zqpbw,"i have had my fair share of ups and downs with mcgill mental health (both counselling and psych) and here are my three biggest pieces of advice:
1. get help early. mental health services are wildly underfunded and understaffed and as the semester progresses this only becomes more and more evident. it takes a very long time for things to get done! expect to wait weeks/months for appointments (especially if it's your first time) and do not let things get to the point of needing a crisis appointment because these appointments aren't usually very helpful and fill up very quickly (they're made on a first come first serve basis) later in the semester the already outrageous wait times for appointments get even longer so make sure to get help ASAP and if it does end up getting to the point of crisis i would highly suggest going to the hospital instead
2. be persistent! because the services are so underfunded and understaffed they will suggest the easiest course of action that they believe still fits your needs. they will push group sessions and impersonal workshops/lectures. they will push using the peer support center. these are all great resources, but if you're looking for more serious one on one therapy or psychiatry then you need to be persistent. you have to state clearly what services you need and do not budge. they will find a way to accommodate your needs but only if you are persistent and confident in voicing them. do not say things like ""oh i was just hoping to..."" or ""i think it might be helpful if..."" go in with a clear purpose and say ""this is what is happening and this is what i want to help me get through it"" this applies for the duration of your care. too many people find the psychiatrists here unhelpful because they aren't being assertive in what they would like. yes the doctor knows the most about medicine, but when it comes to your brain, your body, and your needs then you are the expert. tell your psychiatrist what you want even if it goes against what they say and if they still won't help you out do not be afraid to request a different doctor. 
3. finally, keep ur expectations realistic. many counsellors are just grad students who are, frankly, not as great as an actual therapist would be. but at the end of the day, they are much better than nothing! do not expect to have ur issues resolved immediately. working on mental health is a long process and at mcgill mental health services its even longer. stay positive, stay realistic, and stay healthy. good luck!"
75,9zqpbw,"Personally, I've found counselling quite useless. They just asked me the stereotypical ""so how does that make you feel?"", but once you go to psychiatric services, things are great. My psychiatrist is knowledgeable and very very insightful. Would recommend McGill psychiatric services to everyone."
76,9zqpbw,"I'm not sure how other psychiatrists at McGill treat their patients but mine was completely and utterly non-understanding of my issues and all in all felt like he didn't care one bit about what was going on with me, or even about me as a person. (His name is Robert Franck).

I had to miss an appointment so I couldn't renew my prescription that we had started together. I called to set up a new appointment but of course he was fully booked for a couple weeks before I could see him (even though I explained to the receptionist that I needed to re-fill my prescription, because the medication (+ the dosage) I was on said that there were horrible side effects if stopped immediately). The receptionist told me to file for a renewal from the pharmacy - but no answer from Frank. He had originally given me his email for questions and concerns - no answer when I described the situation I was in. I ended up ending the medication abruptly (this was in December... finals season), and of course had horrible side effects of increased depression, delusions, and 'brain zaps' which greatly effected my performance at the end of the semester (where grades counted the most). I didn't bother going to my next appointment, and he never followed up on me. I sought help during the winter break with my family doctor back home.  

What I am still perplexed with to this day is **why** go into a profession that entails being compassionate and understanding of other people when you don't give a crap about them in the first place?? We don't need you. He truly made my situation worse.

Again - this was just one doctor, not representative of all of them at McGill. Just my experience.

I wish you luck!

\*\*Edit: Name spelling. Also found out that Robert Franck is actually the clinic director at McGill's psychiatric services... Do what you want with that info."
77,9zqpbw,"psychiartric services is an absolute disaster. don't waste your time. especially Denise Rochon, she won't actually listen to anything you're saying and will hand you whatever she thinks will help even if you tell her you dont want medication"
78,9zqpbw,"You get what you pay for. If you're willing to fork out the cash, go off-campus. If not, it's better than nothing. "
79,9zqpbw,Thanks that's really helpful
80,9zqpbw,"+1 for psychiatric services. Was referred there by the Faculty office and it's much, much better than the counselling service I used two years ago. The psychiatrist's session was fast paced and to the point. No BS. No interruptions. I felt like I could really put everything on the table and have her understand and assimilate what I feel.

But also it's not necessarily a bad thing if you don't get a referral. Perhaps it's just not for you."
81,9zqpbw,I'm not very knowledgeable about Quebec law but that sounds like something you could sue about if you were so inclined. At least worth making a fuss to the administration in hopes it doesn't happen to future students. Really unacceptable. 
82,9u5squ,"A lot of people seek on-campus mental health service around midterms/finals because anxiety and depression start to kick in. As a result, the wait list can be very long. Depending on how urgently you think you need it, you can either a) put yourself on the waitlist or b) try to find off-campus services, though you will need to pay for these on your own, so it kind of depends on your financial situation. 

Either way, the process of getting one-on-one help often takes a while, so in the meantime, I would suggest the following:

 - If your academic life is one of the main things causing it, then don't be afraid to step back. You could try to withdraw (do this sooner rather than later if you intend to) from one or more courses to ease the burden. Make sure you go out once in a while and experience things other than the thrill of solving one integral after another. Keep in mind that a mediocre semester isn't the end of the world, and that many people have been worse off academically than you and have gone on to be very successful. 

 - Check out the McGill Nightline. The number of users has gone up substantially over the past couple of years, to the point where they've gotten an increase in funding. If you need someone to just listen while you vent, this is an excellent resource. You might be nervous or hesitant at first, but chances are that 5 minutes in, you'll be glad you did it, and if it's not for you, you can always end the conversation. 

 - McGill has group counselling workshops with various topics such as relationships, dealing with anxiety, speaking in front of others, and various things like that. If you think it might help, try it out. You're not obligated to show up again if you don't find it useful. 

 - If you feel comfortable, pick up the phone and call somebody. Maybe your mom, a friend, a sibling, or whoever else you feel OK talking to. 

 - I'm not sure if Vent Over Tea is available right now, but you basically meet up with one of their volunteers, go for coffee, and talk about whatever you want. It doesn't have to be about the things going on in your life, but it can be. People really like it because it's anonymous and you get to sit down with someone face to face. 

 - If you need an anonymous back and forth with someone who is familiar with the McGill environment, then PM me or someone else on this sub. There are a lot of great people here who are willing to help you out, even if that just means PMing back and forth or having coffee. There was a group of people a couple of months ago who even organized group events for people who felt lonely. Sometimes it also helps just to browse through past posts (like Real Talk Friday) and be able to relate to things that people talk about. Obviously this isn't a substitute for professional help, and I'm not trying to brand it as such, but it does make you feel less alone in the world of McGill. 

 - Lastly, if you're feeling suicidal and think you might be at risk of hurting yourself, seek help ASAP. Go to the hospital, go to Mental Health Services and get an urgent care appointment, or go find another person and stay with them. If someone knocked on my door, even in the wee hours of the morning, and asked for help, you can be sure as shit that they'd get as much of my time as they wanted and their choice of tea from my collection, and I think everyone else would do the same for a fellow human being. You can ask someone else to take you to the hospital (they're open 24/7) if you want, or if nobody's around and none of the above are options, at least get on the phone with someone. Don't hesitate to call 911. There is nothing so insurmountable that you can't work through it. 

*Hugs*"
83,9u5squ,Please have a look at the sidebar (on old.reddit.com/r/mcgill). There are several resources listed there. Best of luck!!
84,9u5squ,"Good for you for reaching out, that's really difficult. You're not alone. The school has counseling services and a mental health service that might be able to help you. There is also a crisis phone number in Montreal if you find yourself in serious acute trouble: 514-723-4000.

Snowflake's comment is more comprehensive than mine, I suggest you check out the resources they suggested. 

I hope you'll be ok. You can find help and support and I really hope you do. "
85,9u5squ,"The McGill health services can have a long wait, especially around finals. I’d suggest looking for some help outside of the school (if possible). Make sure to take time for yourself during these stressful weeks. I’ve recently taken up yoga and mindfulness which helps me cope with my own anxiety and depression. Make sure you have a routine to follow. I know these are really hard times and feel free to drop me a private message if you ever need someone to just chat to. "
86,9u5squ,"This page holds information about counselling services. There are daily drop in slots first come first served. I’d suggest starting with a councillor because then they can refer you to other resources depending on your needs! 

https://mcgill.ca/counselling/urgent-care"
87,9u5squ,"If you want regular sessions then it does take quite a while to get in with mcgill counselling services. But I think they have a new option this year where you can see someone on the day you go in, for working through high stress times I think. I'm not super clear on how it works, but if you go to the office in the brown building (4th floor, room 4200 I think), the 2 front desk people in the room are super friendly and helpful, just make sure to bring you student ID.  

Edit: I think if you google mcgill counselling services they have resources online for  a lot of different mental health issues (including what you listed I think)"
88,9u5squ,Is there a texting based counseling service? I hate talking over the phone and all the offices are pretty far from where I live.
89,8eifri,"This is a very ""yes and no"" type of question. *Should* McGill have to offer these kinds of services? Absolutely not; we should have a better MH care system where public clinics are not completely overloaded and private clinics are better accessible through insurance. Unfortunately, we live in a province, and a country, where mental health care is abysmal. As an institution that a) has a population which would add tremendous strain to the local public clinics b) has the resources, I think it's more than fair for McGill to offer these services.

However, just because including psychiatry + counselling in student health services is the Canadian standard doesn't mean they have to (other schools' health pages just say ""lol go to the clsc""). And when a school chooses to run this kind of clinic, they should be held to the same standard as any other similar service. Here McGill is good because it is confidential, which is unfortunately not the case in other schools, especially in the states; on the other hand, the standard of care is not great. If they can't find a clinic director (which they didn't have for a while) and willing clinicians, they shouldn't be running a service that isn't up to par. 

Having been v mentally ill in two provinces, I can tell you many of the things we complain about, like wait times and feeling rushed through your appointments, are basically the standard for public mental health care. That being said, McGill does fail to deliver on what it promises IMO, especially when you consider a) their total lack of specialists, especially at counselling b) their inability to treat many common illnesses c) their by-the-book approach to symptoms and how those ""should"" present.


TL;DR McGill doesn't need to do this, but IMO because it does it has a responsibility to ensure the service meets the general standard of similar clinics. 


p.s. i hit delete instead of edit the first time im so heartbroken"
90,8eifri,"I think to some extent if an educational institution pretends to shape the best students and to produce the best kind of workers (lawyers, doctors, etc.) they should care about their student's well-being (physical and mental). It's obvious that academic success requires mental and physical well-being, there's nothing new under the sun here.

The issue is this university has over 20 000 students. 

So like I said in another thread, because the university can't cover everyone's mental needs we should have access to external clinics with reduced fares.

It's actually ridiculous that mental health (except psychiatry) isn't covered by the system."
91,8eifri,Does anyone proposing that mcgill fully takes care of mental health services actually have a viable financial plan for it? The only one I see is to charge international students (the main benefactor) more for this service which are also incidentally the people claiming they don’t have any money to put in. It’s really nice to have convictions about mental health and how everyone should have access to these services for free (how can you not agree with this) but it’s a totally different game to actually fund it and put your money where your convictions are. I’d be curious to hear pro-mental health at mcgill people pitch some source of funding / financial plan for it.
92,8eifri,"This is a very different angle, but a person could argue that McGill provides a service that is notorious for causing mental health problems, and as a result they have a responsibility to provide care for it. 

This happens in many other cases. For example, if a type of labour presents a hazard, the worker is compensated (often simply through higher pay). If a person is injured at work, their employer often has to pay their medical bills. When child actors are on a set, the production company has to pay for the schooling they're missing out on. 

It would make sense for McGill to be obligated to pay if their ""service"" causes mental health issues. 

University and mental health aren't entirely separate. A lot of people wouldn't have mental health issues if it weren't for university (though some obviously would), and that's why you could argue that McGill has an obligation. "
93,8eifri,"AFAIK, McGill doesn't have any legal obligations to provide mental health care, but does so because, as is the case with me and many others, international students, who have no other way of receivibg free health care, are not interested in attending an institution that does not take care of the basic needs we need to function.
It is twofold that McGill should do more and that McGill's services do not live up to the standard they should have (long wait times, terrible services, etc.). When people advocate for better mental health services, McGill may not need to provide it, but they also don't need to have charging stations and elevators in their buildings or a large salary for Suzanne Fortier."
94,8eifri,"I can definitely see both sides of the coin, but I lean towards the side of no.

Having clinics and docs on campus is definitely nice to have, but when shit hits the fan, im not going to wait around to get seen by a doc at McGill. 

Same for mental health, it's not like the mental health services at McGill are the ONLY ones you can seek. There are more.

The only group of people that might not have the best access to healthcare are the international students.  Not really sure how to deal with these, but if they are from the states I guess they are already used to paying a fuck ton for healthcare.

"
95,8eifri,"Try 40,000 students"
96,8eifri,"Okay, so (particularly for int'l students) the issue is that McGill's mental health services are provided to you at no cost, and for you and other int'l students is your cheapest/only option for mental healthcare. And the issue is that McGill does not provide adequate mental healthcare services, and therefore makes it difficult for international students to get proper treatment, because seeking professional help off-campus would be too costly. Am I understanding this correctly?"
97,8eifri,So this is the part that is kind of dangerous. Why are elevators less important than mental health ? Its especially peculiqr given how insignificant it is in the budget given that mcgill isnt exactly building a lot right now.
98,8eifri,"As an international student, I highly doubt  mental health care is really a factor in picking McGill for most. When you thought about coming to McGill, was that a factor for you? Would you not have come if they didn't offer free mental health care?"
99,8eifri,"yeah access to health care as an it'l student is pretty rough... would be a lot less rough if we were ever told properly what our benefits were through our insurance and if we could go anywhere else except for the McGill clinic and not pay an exorbitant amount of money. While I am used to paying $20 for a dr's appointment, I'm not used to having to pay for my meds or anything else like that -- with the McGill Blue Cross you gotta pay everything out of pocket and only a certain % is reimbursed, which is such a financial burden."
100,8eifri,"Well it depends on how you count. 

Students	40,971

Undergraduates	27,526

Postgraduates	9,704

Other (e.g. Continuing Education) students
3,741

It's important to note some students also aren't eligible for the service because their Continuing Education students or grad students. EDIT: I MEANT POST_DOCS IM SORRY THAT WAS CONFUSING."
101,8eifri,"Well, yes, except it isn't really ""no cost"" when we spend exponentially more on tuition."
102,8eifri,"Well, I think it's obvious why elevators are more important the mental health, but regardless, that doesn't matter, because I was trying to show that not everything we expect McGill to provide are legal requirements. "
103,8eifri,"If I thought they didn't have health services in general, no, probably not. And any health service should include mental health."
104,8eifri,"Why wouldn't you count graduate students? TBH I don't know, but I was under the impression that McGill counselling/mental health services were open to graduate students too, which would make sense considering that graduate students have higher rates of depression and mental health issues. "
105,8eifri,Graduate students can access the same mental and health care services at McGill as undergraduates... 
106,8eifri,"Yeah, I mean at no additional cost. Thanks for explaining it!

Also cdn tuition is subsidized by taxes (ie higher sales tax, higher income taxes, etc.), which is why it's less for domestic students. It's offset but we pay in tax."
107,8eifri,Actually McGill may have to meet some legal obligations on making their buildings wheelchair accessible. So they may actually be obligated to build elevators.
108,8eifri,So you picked a university based on what health services they offer? I personally think that's quite silly. You could always use other health services outside of the university no matter where you are. 
109,8eifri,"I literally just saw your comment and /u/DNA_ligation 's comment - my bad I apologize, by grad students i meant post_docs, my exam brain is being funny. "
110,8eifri,"I'm aware, but I think the large additional cosy should at least be taken into consideration when discussing the fact that international students have no viable alternative."
111,8eifri,"I mean, do international students not pay that tax? I definitely pay sales tax and income tax as an international student. "
112,8eifri,Are they obligated to have fancy residences with flat screens in every room?
113,8eifri,"I didn't pick it based on that, but considering I have chronic illnesses, a school without it would be unacceptable in my eyes.

And no, I can't use other services. I don't have the money."
114,8eifri,"Oh no worries, just wanted to check! Good luck on your exams if you have any left!"
115,8eifri,Alternative to mental health services?
116,8eifri,"McGill does not receive all the money from international students. far from it actually. so the ""paying a lot of money"" is true on your side but mcgill does not see you as someone who pays a lot more because they dont get that money"
117,8eifri,Does every international student have to file a Canadian tax return? I’m not being snide I genuinely don’t know.
118,8eifri,"No, I understand your point. It would be nice if McGill offered better mental health services instead of some of the other things they choose to invest in. 

That said, if you are looking for consistent, reliable and professional help, please consider seeing a private therapist. Yes it costs money, but if your alternative is waiting months for poor care, you may find much better progress from paying for this service, if you can. Canadian students also have to pay for psychologists because it isn't covered by provincial healthcare (at least not OHIP). It is shitty that McGill can't provide that though, I understand your frustration.

Thanks for sharing your info, I definitely understand a lot better now. Good luck!"
119,8eifri,"I mean... For buildings that function as hotels in the summer, I'd say it's pretty important to have regular hotel things."
120,8eifri,"You don't need to downvote me if you disagree, that's not what downvotes are for. I had no idea you had chronic illnesses, definitely in your case then, obviously health services are an important factor. But I think most international students are lucky to be in good health and will not even consider what health services a university offers in making a decision on where to go. I don't think McGill really needs to offer health services to attract most international students, 95% come to McGill because of its prestige, affordability and/or international reputation/diversity and wouldn't refuse to come if they didn't provide health services. "
121,8eifri,Yeah. None thay won't cost a lot of money over time.
122,8eifri,"Pardon my ignorance, but can you expand on this? With a brief overview of my student account (I'm from the states) I don't see much that isn't going towards McGill. Unless it's hidden in my tuition, or you're considering SSMU fees and such not to count, the only thing I see is $2.00 for World Univ Services Canada."
123,8eifri,"> mcgill does not see you as someone who pays a lot more

maybe not through tuition fees directly, but I think these are safe assumptions:

1. total cost of attendance for international students is high enough that international students tend to be in a higher ""spending bracket"" than canadian or quebec students (i.e. those international students who would be more likely to be frugal are simply not able to jump the hurdle of international tuition fees to attend mcgill in the first place)

2. the university can still scrape lots of money from internationals through more expensive rez options, on-campus dining, and book sales. perhaps this is anecdotal, but the international students i knew in first year were more likely to shoulder these extra costs as part of the ""university experience"" than canadian and quebec students."
124,8eifri,"To be honest, I don't know; my impetus for starting to do so was because I've had a part-time job here for a few years and I lose a lot of that money because of taxes. "
125,8eifri,"No, not all of them do. "
126,8eifri,"Thanks, but I don't have the money to pay for therapists. "
127,8eifri,Are they obligated to have them function as hotels in the summer? Is that more important than mental health?
128,8eifri,"You're right, I only downvoted because others were downvoting my posts, but I shouldn't have done that. Sorry.

The question is not whether McGill NEEDS to do it. It's whether it's, you know, the right thing to do, and whether it's something worth fighting for."
129,8eifri,"I mean.... that's true for everyone? In theory Canadian students have access to the public mental health services run by the government; in practice these are often worse and even more overloaded than McGill's. For example, the wait time in Ontario before I left was over one year, and last year when I attempted to receive public mental health care because McGill wasn't enough for me, the wait time was six months. In fact, I was told that as a McGill student I had no business taking up services when I have access to similar ones on campus (ridiculous but not the point). I guess what I'm saying is as a Canadian student, all my options take either more time than anything international students have access to, or as much money if you have good enough insurance to go private.

Not to say I'm not glad to have public options (bless the new psych ward at Montreal General) but just some perspective re. many people's argument that campus MH services should be primarily for international students."
130,8eifri,The government perceives a large amount of that money and it goes to other universities. I think /u/Dowz3r knows better than me how this works.
131,8eifri,"One is income generating, one is not. So yes, unless you want even less resources.  

You don't just leave income generating assets idle for the sake of saving money lmaoo"
132,8eifri,[literally this](https://i.imgur.com/sIgJk7e.png)
133,8eifri,"Well, you said that the reason McGill provides health services is that international students ""are not interested in attending an institution that does not take care of the basic needs we need to function"". That's what I disagree with you on, because I doubt that's really the reason they provide such services. I do think that while McGill doesn't need to provide such services, they should and it is something worth fighting for. "
134,8eifri,That's a good point. I think that just highlights the disgusting attitude towards mental health in Canada and shows that we need to make more progress.
135,8eifri,"Weeee hello hello, i typically avoid these topics but for you /u/Thermidorien i'll oblige. 

/u/TiocfaidhArLatte - so when Therm says ""we don't receive all the money from international students"", it's actually both Canadian Out of Province and International Students. The way the tuition works in Quebec is anything more than the Quebec rate is taken by the Provincial Government and pooled. Then based on a formulae, which Im going to go look for when I'm procrastinating (but now I can't, sry), the Provincial Government re-allocates funds. So of the 36,000 a international student pays in Engineering in ""tuition"", specifically the Base Tuition and International Supplement on your E-Bill Summary, McGill will be back only about 24-26,000 depending on the year. That other $10,000 is split between other universities in quebec, that are smaller, or don't have high international student turnouts. It is primarily McGill, Concordia, and Bishops that are affected by this, however with French students form France paying regular out-of-province rates, McGill has been able to recoup a lot of money (at the expense of Sherbrooke, Laval, UdeM, and ETS which use to be major benefactors of the system). 

To be more clear, the tuition cost codes are: 

T1QP (Quebec Tuition) which goes to McGill

TOOP (Out Of Province Supplement) 
international I think is TOOC (Out of Canada Supplement) 
The later two go to the Province. 


"
136,8eifri,"Okay, let me put it a different way.

Are they obligated to have fancy rezes with flatscreens in every room that function as hotels in the summer?

Or are they obligated to have charging stations in the libraries? Or multimedia auditoriums?"
137,8eifri,I meant that are they obligated to have rezes so fancy they function as hotels in the summer? They seem to be fine with Universiry Hall not functioning like that.
138,8eifri,"I should have specified then: ""students who require repeated care are not interested..."" But even so, it's really not a good look for McGill if Concordia or UdeM can say they have proper health services while they don't, and it will drive some people away. Not everyone, sure, but maybe more than you think."
139,8eifri,"> charging stations in the libraries

these were the result of polls directed at students when asked how library spaces could be improved with the SSMU library improvement fund (correct me if i'm wrong /u/simpletongue)

> multimedia auditoriums

this is a result of having to find ways to efficiently deliver content to courses of 200+ people. it's also 2018 and we aren't using quills and parchment anymore"
140,8eifri,"> Are they obligated to have fancy rezes with flatscreens in every room that function as hotels in the summer?

* they own land where they can build a student residence

* student residences are pretty much idle assets during the summer

* students are willing to pay overinflated fees just to have the Residence Experience™

So for all these conditions, it makes a lot of sense to develop the land they own into a hotel-style residence because it will bring in the most income for the asset while satisfying requirements as as student residence. I'm pretty glad we don't have people like you in decision-making positions, because that is how bureaucratic organizations start making idiotic decisions and squander their resources."
141,8eifri,"AFAIK hotel rezes were hotels before they were rezes and increasing student numbers required more residence space so they looked to areas near campus to purchase in order to accommodate new students

So its less of a 'obligation to  have rezes so fancy they function as hotels in the summer' and more of an obligation to accommodate students near(ish) campus and hotels were an option

Note that in the residences that were not hotels beforehand there aren't flat screens in every room (again, afaik) because they were not hotels *before* mcgill purchased them - uni hall did not exist as a hotel before being owned by mcgill, so it was not outfitted like one (with tvs, etc), and so it is not cost effective for mcgill to rent it out like a hotel in summer since it would cost them greatly to format it into a hotel "
142,8eifri,You are correct about the charging stations. 
143,8eifri,"There are of course reasons to have these things. You're arguing against a straw man. I'm asking if they are obligated to have them.

They aren't. Yes, there are reasons to have them, but there are reasons to have mental health services. I think mebtal health services are more important than any of the things I mentioned."
144,8eifri,"And additionally, I don't know for sure if they break even on rez from students, but I would certainly hope they do with how much they charge lol"
145,8eifri,"1. Most rezes still aren't fancy hotel-style resodences that function as hotels in the summer, so it is still clearly not necessary.

2. Whether or not it brings in income is irrelevant. I'm asking whether or not it is necessary.

Having these things may be a better business decision that investing in students' mental health, clearly, but why in the world am I as a student obligated to be concerned with the fat cats running McGill making the most amount of money possible? I don't bloody work for them."
146,8eifri,"for the library stuff, yeah they're kind of obligated to listen to input that they solicited.

and for multimedia classrooms, yes they are obligated because it is impossible otherwise to deliver content efficiently to large classes"
147,8eifri,It's not like they pocket that money ? McGill is a public institution. 
148,8eifri,"> Most rezes still aren't fancy hotel-style resodences that function as hotels in the summer, so it is still clearly not necessary.

these are older buildings that would cost more to upgrade or demolish & rebuild than maintaining them as-is for now

> why in the world am I as a student obligated to be concerned with the fat cats running McGill making the most amount of money possible

because the money they are making is directly contributing to your experience at McGill. Anything you see, touch, or hear on campus is likely a result of fiscal responsibility. any jackass can start a university of their own but they literally require organizational knowledge to scale up to any respectable size without wasting resources. mental health is certainly important, but the university **should not** pull back from its other day-to-day tasks in existing. if they stop thinking about making use of their other assets, the state of things will worsen even more.

it almost seems like you are suggesting that assets should be liquidated to supplement the mental health budget. just look at this from the bigger perspective - this institution has literally millions of other things that are essential to a university, and they cannot completely neglect any one thing to favour another.

it really does suck that mental health services has apparently been put on the chopping board first, but if you're going to criticize the university, don't make the mistake of suggesting further cuts in infrastructure. the buildings are already literally crumbling from years of deferred maintenance. if anything, executive salaries should be slashed, but these things were contracted years ago by the board of governors and are legally impossible to be reduced. please don't whine about elevators and TVs in residences when there are far more productive targets to your grievances."
149,8eifri,"Um...no, they're not obligated to do that. And they weren't obligated to solicit that input in the first place.

Um, my Math class doesn't use those multimedia options, but class still runs fine even though there are hundreds of students."
150,8eifri,"I really don't think McGill's budget is completely used in a totally fiscally responsible way, especially since as you mentioned the salaries of the executives are so high. There are also things like T.V.s in SSMU and huge multimedia auditoriums that are not necessary and don't bring in income. There are so many things at McGill that are just nice things to have that don't bring in income and aren't necessary, but are still there, and I think that before having any of those things we should have proper mental health services.

And why can't they neglect one thing to favour another? That's what they're doing right now."
151,8eifri,"1. it's a fee that is collected from all students by SSMU, with the condition that student input is solicited on how best to use the funds. you get emails about this, there are posters, and it's in your bill every semester.

2. since you apparently can't get your head out of your ass to look beyond your own experience, maybe it will surprise you to know that there are, for example, 600+ student life sci courses that are impossible to teach without a projector connected to a computer. how do you suggest teaching a lecture about microscopy using a chalkboard?"
152,8eifri,"> T.V.s in SSMU

SSMU gets ad revenue from those screens... which is why they run ads

> And why can't they neglect one thing to favour another? That's what they're doing right now.

did you even read the last paragraph of my response?"
153,8eifri,"1. Fair. I didn't know that.

2. Do you mind telling me how those courses were taught before the advent of these resources? I've done life sci courses and don't see what couldn't be taught with just a textbook."
154,8eifri,"Also, I could do without the insults, thanks."
155,8eifri,"Okay, my point with bringing up these examples was not to specifically say thise things should be cut, or those things are specifically the worst offenders. You're taking it a bit too literally while missing the message. My point was that not everything we have at McGill is necessary to its function or makes money. Do you disgaree with that?"
156,8eifri,"for 2: before the advent of these resources, the field was far back enough where chalkboard teaching would be sufficient to present what were much simpler concepts back then - that is no longer the case. look at how new research is presented at conferences now - the days of someone standing at a podium talking drily about the last tadpole they sketched are long gone. as humans, we have progressed so much in the ways of presenting knowledge to each other, and to neglect that progress in our classrooms would be an unnecessary hobble on progress in education."
157,8eifri,"> My point was that not everything we have at McGill is necessary to its function or makes money.

i agree, but half-baked examples are not helping your point. one big criticism of the admin is that they are disconnected and insulated, but those terms are just as applicable to nearly everything you've said in this thread"
158,8eifri,But why couldn't those be taught with a textbook?
159,8eifri,"Being honest, I just came up with the first examples that came to my mind, but I haven't been at McGill long enough to know the complex reasons behind the existence of those things. I do know however that not everything McGill has is profitable or necessary."
160,8eifri,"you can, but slides are easier to update with new knowledge than a textbook. also a textbook is limited to images that are stationary - slides on a screen can also have videos and sound, hence the term **multi**media.

since you're quite concerned about cost to the student, perhaps you can appreciate that it doesn't make much sense to force 600 students to spend 100$ on a new textbook every year (and that's just one course), as opposed to spending 2000$ on a really good projector, screen, and speakers that will all last for at least 5 years. for most lifesci courses, a textbook isn't even necessary. students save money, and the university invests in a multimedia classroom - an excellent tradeoff."
161,8eifri,"it's fine to ask questions to know more! just don't be too quick to forming opinions on what should or shouldn't be cut. i'm pretty much on my way out so i've had the privilege of getting to know more about the ""true"" situation, which as with many things, is more complex than it appears at the surface level."
162,8eifri,"Honestly I don't want to keep going down this rabbit hole. I think I already made my point elsewhere that the primary message has been missed, and continuing to participate in this pedantoc argument is this not useful. "
163,8eifri,I guess my point was misinterpreted. I wasn't saying these were the first things I would cut if I were in charge (except Fortier's pay). I don't know the situation well enough ro say what O would cut. I was just trying to make the point that not everything is necessary or profitable. I really didn't expect people to take the examples so literally.
164,8eifri,*you* don't want to go down this rabbit hole? you're the one holding the shovel lol
165,8f2fj0,"TL;DR
At McGill, 30% of the students suffer from anxiety, depression or severe stress. In the past 5 years, McGill psychological services have received an over 25% increase in requests for help. This crisis of lack of well-being is also observed in other Canadian universities.
"
166,8f2fj0,"Well I just finished a final where the prof didn't state that we were allowed a crib sheet on the slides, outline, or on MyCourses. At least I had the class as an S/U and only need 48% to graduate but what the fuck? In my four years here this is the first time the professor leaves their students this clueless on the format of the final.

Fuck this goddamn school and the shit profs that teach here. I'm glad I'm graduating. No fucking wonder students here are under a shit ton of stress."
167,8f2fj0,"just want to point out that with this data, it's unclear if the 25% increase is due to worsening conditions which exacerbate mental health problems, or if it is from increased ""comfort"" (less stigma) with seeking help"
168,8f2fj0,"Yes yes... let the hate flow through you. Sometimes I see posts about would you change schools if you could pick again and people out here like ""Nah McGill top pick NA hands down"". I'm like what the hell program did you choose because it's not 1 bad experience, it's a myriad of them that really kill any sort of good, at least in engineering.  "
169,8f2fj0,What class was this? I might have written the same final haha 
170,8f2fj0,This^guy^has^a^point
171,8f2fj0,"Whatever the reason, such an increase in seeking services highlights the need to ensure they are accessible to students"
172,8f2fj0,Its probably both
173,8f2fj0,"How about the amount of people who went to get a first meeting, were told to wait 3 months, and dropped the idea of even attempting to get help? Hi ^thats ^^meeeee

Cofounding variables are aweful, and are largely spotted and recognized via different subjective outlooks. You spotted one, you are missing many.

OFF SUBJECT: Hence why qualitative analysis always wins sorry not sorry"
174,8f2fj0,phys 183
175,8f2fj0,It also highlights the increasing difficulty of providing them
176,8f2fj0,"> OFF SUBJECT: Hence why qualitative analysis always wins sorry not sorry

not really, this just shows that data doesn't mean anything unless you consider the input of underlying factors. more data with some more discerning questions must be collected to parse out those factors."
177,8f2fj0,Are you serious?! Usually I’m not bothered by people complaining like this but Prof. Kaspi is one of my favourites and I am blown away that you would say that. How did you not notice that every one had a crib sheet at the midterm? She mentioned Crib sheets in a number of lectures (which you probably skipped) and she even made an announcement on MyCourses about Crib sheets. Sorry for the hate but this rattles me like crazy because she is an awesome prof and the only reason you’re complaining is because you didn’t put enough effort into her course
178,8f2fj0,Yup. I only knew about the crib sheet from the fb group
179,8f2fj0,"There is no announcement concerning the format on the final, not quite sure what you’re talking about. Even another commenter had absolutely no idea other than getting info from the fb group. 

I can’t comment on the lectures I missed many of them. Posting information about something worth 50% of your grade should be a little more important that something you say here and there.  "
180,8f2fj0,"I was talking about the announcement titled “Midterms and Crib Sheets”, I never said it had anything to do with the final format, I was just saying that it was clear we were allowed to use a crib sheet. 

Also, if you skipped a lot of lectures, I really don’t think you’re in any position to complain about the lack of information provided to the students because trust me, if you had gone to lectures, you would only have good things to say about Prof Kaspi and her course."
181,8f2fj0,"A single announcement stating that you can pick up your midterm and cribsheet is not the same as saying you’re allowed to have one for the final. 

I’ve went to some lectures, but wasn’t able to make it to others. I don’t have any specific complaints on her lecturing style. My first criticism of the course would have having a portion of your grade attributed to participation in clicker questions. 

Again, throughout my stay at mcgill information such as this is usually made very clear"
182,8f2fj0,Why else would you want to pick up your crib sheet???? This is going no where :(
183,8f2fj0,What exactly did you not understand from my point? The announcement had nothing to do about the final.
184,8whde4,"Have you considered contacting some of the clubs and groups on campus working on the issue? Some of the unionized workers' that disagree with the mental health policies @ McGill? Even SSMU / other student groups off campus?  To people who have reported on the situation over the past several years (the daily comes in mind)? Like there is a lot of pre-existing resources and past campaigns to push for better awareness and care around mental health at McGill.

This is a much better place to start organizing whatever than on reddit"
185,8whde4,we also need a rally for better student advising services. seriously like 6 advisors for ALL science students at mcgill?! whata joke
186,8whde4,[deleted]
187,8whde4,"Hiya! I love where your head's at! I'm gonna echo Zaratustash & taytots505 and suggest getting a feel for what the current situation is / what's being done right now with regard to this issue. The groups and orgs that have been listed already are doing great stuff, and I'm sure you'd get some good context + ideas by reaching out to them. For more context about the state of mental health services at McGill, I'd recommend checking out some of the media coverage this issue has gotten over the past few years (both in the student press + mainstream media). That should give you a sense of what advocacy has already been done, and how admin + Student Services tend to respond to student pressure. And last but not least, if you're serious about the possibility of mobilizing students around mental health this year, shoot an email to my colleague Sophia Esterle at studentlife@ssmu.ca - Sophia is the SSMU exec whose portfolio is most closely tied to mental health, and she's super passionate about this topic! If you do reach out to Sophia, I'd love it if you cc'd me as well (Marina Cupido - external@ssmu.ca) since my portfolio deals with student campaigns, and I could hook you up with folks beyond McGill who are doing mental health work. Hope this helps, and best of luck with whatever you decide to do - there's a massive amount of progress to be made on improving mental health services at McGill and reducing stigma!"
188,8whde4,"Okay, just some questions/comments about this:

1. What would you like the university to do? If you have very specific and reasonable asks of McGill, the admins will probably be more likely to listen than if you come in guns blazing just demanding they be ""more aware"" of mental health without offering any tangible solutions (or by being blatantly disrespectful). If you do the latter, there's a strong chance that they don't bat an eye to the issue. 

2. Don't block doors/exits to buildings or block city traffic. First of all, blocking doors is a violation of fire safety code. Second of all, don't make life a living hell for people who have nothing to do with this issue. Causing that kind of disruption is more likely to land you in handcuffs than cause a palpable change on campus.

3. What is the precise goal of this march/rally? Many of the ""protests"" we see nowadays tend to not have very specific goals in mind and if they do, they're not ones that your average Joe can do anything about. To reiterate my first point, if you just tell McGill admins to be ""more aware"" of mental health they probably will say there's not much they can do. But if you offer specific steps they can take towards tackling this issue, they might actually sit down with mental health groups on campus and try to figure something out.

4. More specifically to mental health: I think mental health awareness has been raised over and over again. And let's not forget the obvious which is that people without certain mental health issues cannot fully feel/understand the struggles that individuals who do have these challenges face.   

Now let's cut to the chase...to be brutally honest, I don't think any sort of rally is going to result in any noticeable change or improvements to mental health on campus. Again, I'd love to see the university improve their services and do more for students with mental health problems, but I also wonder how much they're even allowed to do to begin with. For all we know they have some legal or bureaucratic roadblocks that make the fight for necessary improvements nearly impossible. That being said, keep the fight going because it certainly is a good cause, but consider other approaches to this issue other than a disruptive rally (one that is unlikely to result in any real positive outcome)."
189,8whde4,Do you know any of those clubs? I'm not aware unfortunately :( :(
190,8whde4,"Depends what you mean by ""rally"" tbh

10 people in Community Square? Bleh

A demo encompassing both students from McGill and other campuses in the city, flooding the campus and blocking exits from admin building: better

Same applies to occupation:

Occupation where you get quarantined in a spot the admin chose and which does not impact their functioning: bleh

Occupation where you disrupt the functioning of the admin: better.

Basically, if you want a direct action that gets some goods, there is no point in it being symbolical, purely out of bother's way, etc, other than make the participants feel good and allies feel like they deserve brownie points, while admin enjoys some scenery. You have to make an impact in the institution's normal functioning/wallet/whatever 

"
191,8whde4,"Idk, but we might as well try. It's important to raise awareness and make people aware that mental health is something we care about and want taken seriously. If anything it might create more understanding with people in the community."
192,8whde4,Thank you! This is very helpful.
193,8whde4,"I am an exec for Students in Mind! Every year we organize a mental health conference on campus aimed at starting dialogue, educating and providing concrete skills for mentsl health. I can also suggest Jack.org, vent over tea, ssmu mental health and peer support centre in terms of other on campus groups! "
194,8whde4,"There used to be a neuroatypical group, but I don't know if they are active anymore. 

A good place to start for campus organizing on social, health, and class issues is always QPIRG-McGill tho!"
195,8whde4,"Occupation works for certain issued. Concordia computer riots? Absolutely. Raise awareness for MH initiatives? Nah.

First, you're organizing a disruption that can block services to those you're purporting to help. Second, people living with anxiety and depression, important voices to listen to, may not feel welcome in such an overt action.

There are times for disruption. There are times when working and advocating within the system are far better. Advocates cannot lose sight of the populations that they're working with/for.
"
196,8whde4,"I think on the topic of mental health ""awareness"" has already been raised and raised and raised "
197,8whde4,What is that?
198,8whde4,I think there's the issue that most students are only around for four years but admin is forever. They can just ride out any issues and the most angry a student can ever be is 4 years worth. Then they just cycle out and you have new students. Hard to build momentum to make really big changes.
199,8whde4,Yet nothing significant has happened. Therefore we need to raise it more.
200,8whde4,"Okay, but what exactly do you want to see change? Simply ""raising more awareness"" is probably not going to result in any meaningful change. You have to get more specific in terms of goals and desired outcomes and create a solid plan."
201,86kknp,"Yes and no.  The waitlist is fffffffffffffff*ffffffffffuckedddd*, but once I actually got in, it help itself was effective."
202,86kknp,they actually aren't that bad but aren't that good. don't let all the complaining about services stop you from reaching out. they are there and they will help you to the best of their abilities in my experience but beware that they are ridiculously short staffed and may not be able to see you today. 
203,86kknp,"If you have been before, you might be able to get a safety appointment which is much faster. Otherwise, especially at this time of year, the waitlist is quite long. I'm sorry, it's not a very good system. They told me they don't have the resources to talk to everyone who feels sad which is........ a professional thing to say to someone with depression I guess. But good luck. Just know that now counseling and psychiatric are separate so the one side won't want to counsel and the other won't be able to prescribe.  "
204,86kknp,No. 
205,86kknp,"I did not appreciate the help I got from them. But still, don't hesitate to reach out even if it's outside McGill."
206,86kknp,"I would say that it's still worth a try. Like what the others say, Mental Health Services is decent, though not necessarily outstanding, after you get past the waitlist stage. The wait time is typically about a month at this time of year for a counsellor, and 2-3 weeks for a psychiatrist. Make sure you know what help you need because counsellors can't prescribe meds and psychiatrists don't really counsel. Some students will end up requiring both services and in such cases you'd need to make separate appointments for both. 

Meanwhile, to tie you through until your appointment, you can go have a look at TAO (Therapist Assisted Online) [here](https://www.mcgill.ca/counselling/getstarted/tao), which has online videos and tutorials in CBT/mindfulness that may assist in relieving the symptoms of various mental illnesses (depression, anxiety). It's not a full substitute for professional advice, but it doesn't harm to try it out. 

Ah and as for medications, I've actually gotten from them a walk-in clinic off-campus, since you technically don't need to see a psychiatrist to get antidepressants. However, if you do go for this route, make sure you ask for a referral to a psychiatrist at the same time so you can get an appointment with McGill psychiatry to stay updated regarding your medications. "
207,86kknp,"Don't let the thought of a long waitlist stop you from reaching out - they might have a cancellation and could fit you in earlier. In the meantime, even though they are closed since the SSMU closure, check out Peer Support Centre and Nightline, which I believe is still open.

Edit: The Peer Support Centre is open again in their new location!"
208,86kknp,"Note: International insurance covers 750$ a year of psychologist/psychiatrist expenses outside mcgill (80% per session). Dunno the national policy but I bet it’s even better. 

Mcgill’s been pretty helpful for me in terms of therapy. Can’t say much about the group workshops, but i meet about once a week with a nice lady and i’ve found it useful to identify issues and create strategies to tackle them. Mostly depression and anxiety, along with background baggage. 

Life is shitty hard and it takes initiative more than anything to deal with it. If they meet you to interview you make sure you have a clear idea of what you need help with and what it is that you want to get out of it. Bad communication leads to bad assignment of resources; so you’ll probably be unhappy w their offer if you aren’t clear. It’s ok to not know or understand yourself, but then say that. "
209,86kknp,"I think the quality highly depends on the person you see, which is really just about luck. I love my current psychiatrist, but I've seen some other people in the past who did more harm than good. "
210,86kknp,"I agree with several of the comments on this thread. It really depends who you get, and the wait list IS painfully long (2 months in my case). More importantly, I think, is how open you are to talk-therapy. While getting advice from a professional counsellor might provide you with temporary solace, McGill Counselling makes a pretty big point of telling you that it’s temporary. I was referred to an outside clinic (that would have to be covered by provincial/private insurance) after my first session. They (McGill) booked a second appointment for me but maintained their position as a “temporary solution” for students. If you’re cool with that, go for it. "
211,86kknp,"Counselling I've had good experiences with, psychiatry not so much. 

The only thing is that as exams approach, the waitlist gets longer and longer. We're pretty close to finals already, so it would have been best for you to make an appointment earlier in the semester. You can still try, but there's a good chance that you won't get in for more than one appointment for the remainder of the year, especially since they end earlier (I think) than everyone else (something like halfway through April). Once you get in it's really good though. "
212,7f3twr,okay but have you tried not being so stressed?
213,7f3twr,"Oh wowie I can't believe a new alternative has come out to the medication I've been prescribed by the McGill psychiatrists, I can't wait for this to give me all the benefits of my medication without the side effects that I hate

Thanks Dyens! /s"
214,7f3twr,these are so spicy i love it
215,7f3twr,Can someone link me/tell me what happened with this guy?
216,7f3twr,[deleted]
217,7f3twr,also 40 minutes of physical activity a day!!
218,7b1zep,i went to mcgill counselling a year ago and the guy bluntly told me that I was wasting his time and that i just had 'bad habits'.... i cannot believe what came out of his mouth lmao
219,7b1zep,Mcgill psychiatrists are trash - FACTS 
220,7b1zep,I've had good experiences with the Douglas
221,7b1zep,"I hated my psychiatrist at McGill, I have my reasons but I am procrastinating writing this paper so I won't list them. I felt he was very snobbish and I felt like a burden to him, but it didn't last long. He told me he couldn't help me anymore and I needed to seek outside help for CBT therapy and gave me a bunch of numbers for other psychiatrists. He told me that for some of them my McGill insurance would cover 80%"
222,7b1zep,I've been seeing Dr. Franck and he's been great so far. I much prefer him over my psychologist from home; he was very informative and made sure to give me options instead of telling me what to do. I had already been diagnosed though so that might have helped. He also gave me a list of recommended psychologists outside of Mcgill. You can probably get the same list at psychiatry reception or I could DM you it if you want. I think there was one that was covered by school insurance but most weren't. There were some that had sliding scale though. 
223,7b1zep,"I saw Dr Eller and I felt like he didn't listen to me at all, he slut shamed me for experiences I disclosed and didn't help me at all with the ssri side effects I wanted changed. McGill mental health is a joke. I don't have any advice just wanted to share my own shitty experience. "
224,7b1zep,"A few things:

 - If you're trying to get an ADHD diagnosis, don't bother. You'll be paying out of pocket, and it will cost you well over $1000. 


 - I agree with you. I saw Dr. Franck last year, and he didn't even try to hide the fact that he wanted me out of his office as fast as possible. A vending machine would have taken longer to give me my prescriptions. Whatever your issue, he just throws drugs at you and if you complain, he just raises the dosage. 


 - Don't even try McGill Mental Health. They're booked into January ATM, and it's NOT worth the wait. 


 - I think they'll cover 80%. 


 - With that being said, do make sure to consider her opinion. Meds are great and you may very well need them, but they're not a substitute for a strong work ethic and they don't magically make stress go away. Make sure you're doing your part and giving it a fair shake. "
225,7b1zep,Who did you have? 
226,7b1zep,Do you know where I could get the list of psychs covered by our insurance? 
227,7b1zep,I had a similar experience with mine 
228,7b1zep,"I have Dr. Franck as my psychiatrist too and I must say I share the same thoughts. At the end of my last appointment, he made a very inappropriate joke about suicide, which left me speechless and angry..."
229,7b1zep,"- If you are trying to get an ADHD diagnosis, the OSD has a new program that is subsidized! 
- There is a new program at SSMU for counselling services that is free if you are under the health or dental plan 
- Psychiatry can refer you out to other programs, but in my experience, they are just a med shop. If you want psychotherapy or counselling consider using your health insurance for a psychologist or counsellor."
230,7b1zep,I dont know where I put that paper but when I find it I can just send it to you. Also maybe the front desk at the mental health services could help you.
231,7b1zep,Ugh. Unfortunately that sounds like him. 
232,7b1zep,holy shit .. yeah i had him for awhile first year and i literally saw him for two minutes each time. i remember one time i went in there a week or so after being sexually assaulted and i tried to bring it up but i didn't get a chance bc he just rushed me out so fast and i always look back on that and think about how much easier it would have been for me to get closure on that situation if i was able to talk to my psych about it. what joke did he make about suicide?
233,7b1zep,"Sure, with OSD you might spend $1000 instead to $1200 or something, but you'll also be waiting and continuing to struggle for several months because it takes so damn long to navigate the system. I say this having recently gone through the process myself.  

In any case, OP isn't necessarily pursuing an ADHD diagnosis at all, it was more for others' general inquiry. "
234,7b1zep,"I was telling him about my occasional suicidal thoughts and social anxiety and he wrote down stuff onto his notepad for my prescription and said as he was chuckling ""oh you know the last thing we want is for our patients to die"" and I was like ""wtf!?!"" If a professional/an authority figure at a leading institution in medical research has the balls to say this then I frankly have no hope...

Also my appointments with him usually last 03 mins, 05 if I'm lucky... this man won't listen to you and just shoves medications in your face."
235,7b1zep,I'm not looking for an ADHD diagnosis but I hope if anyone looking through the thread but I hope it helps other people needing advice on it. I know from friends that it's ridiculously hard to get information from McGill cause they assume your doing it just for the drugs
236,7b1zep,oh my god.... i don't even know what to say. last time i was in there i overheard him and dr choo talking about how they aren't that busy and they find it easy to work there..... i was like are you fucking kidding me ??? I always tried to justify the shorter appointments by telling myself they're just too busy but that really pissed me off. i'd love to know what he does with the 90% of his time where he isn't speaking with patients
237,7b1zep,"They certainly do, especially if the tests aren't entirely conclusive. My testing showed that 98% of the population is more focused/less distractible than I am, so I'm a pretty solid case, but I have even heard cases in which universities question established diagnoses and ask for retesting, especially when a student switches schools. 


Keep in mind, though, that they aren't exactly wrong. Stimulant abuse is a huge problem on campuses, especially highly competitive ones. Not enough resources are dedicated to educating people about the potential consequences that this can have. It's bad for your health and quickly becomes addictive, not to mention the fact that it's illegal and a serious violation of academic integrity. 


It's unfortunate that people feel that desperate, and it points to larger issues surrounding the pressure that universities put on students. Personally, I've found McGill to be downright brutal at times in terms of the expectations they set for students, and I'm sure we're not the only school. "
238,7qpsps,"Hey there, please don't cancel your appointment. First of all, everything that goes on during the appointment is kept confidential, unless the counsellor has reason to believe you are at risk of self-harm (not too common) and within the legal limits of the law. 

Generally, you will start off the appointment by describing what has been bothering you. perhaps your symptoms, what triggered your anxiety, what worsens it, strategies that you have attempted, how successful or futile those strategies were etc. The counsellor may also ask questions to get a general feel of your personal background, since some mental health disorders can be caused by things such as family issues or a difficult childhood. 

There isn't a huge lot that can be done in just one session, but towards the end of the session the counsellor will discuss potential strategies and resources, perhaps give you handouts to fill in to keep track of your progress until the next session. You may get a referral for psychiatry if your counsellor feels that your symptoms are bad enough to warrant pharmacotherapy (antidepressants and the sort...). 

I really think you shouldn't be worried about preparing yourself thoroughly for the appointment. It isn't an interview. Well, it kinda is, but it should never have to be as intimidating as a job interview. Imagine that the counsellor there is a friend that you trust. The other thing is that you should not expect instant relief after one session. It often takes weeks before you start feeling better. Most importantly, do not be afraid of advocating for yourself, and always take the time to take care of yourself whenever you're having a bad day. "
239,7qpsps,"Hey, dont cancel please.
Ironically I went today in the morning and although I was on the verge of tears explaining to this stranger my lifes troubles. It felt good to finally tell someone about it. These people know how to talk to you and understand you, they have empathy more than anyone. This is a step in the right direction and it'll make you feel less alone even if its a little bit. "
240,7qpsps,"Your first appointment will be about 50 minutes long. They will ask you why you decided to come see them. From that point on, they'll ask you a bunch of different questions based on what they think might be the issue/issues. For example, I went because of bipolar/attention deficit/depression, and I sort of knew that going in, so I told them that and the rest of the appointment was them kin of going on different tangents and directions with different questions to pinpoint what your symptoms/barriers are and potential causes that might be helpful to know when they're trying to help you. 

Basically, they want to establish:

a) Why/how it's causing problems for you

b) Whether you're a risk to yourself, which is important to rule out or recognize because intervening right away could prevent some serious events

c) What the issue is and whether it's the same as what you think you have. For example, I didn't realize that attention deficit was a big problem for me until it was pointed out, so I completely missed that. You might also ""misdiagnose"" yourself. 

d) The specifics of how you got to be where you are in the first place. Was it a traumatic event? Chronic stress? What is the source of that stress? What support systems/resources do you have in your life?


After that, you'll usually go in and see someone for 45 minutes every two weeks (sometimes every week or once a month depending on your needs). 

I've been through that process a couple of times and currently see both a counsellor and a psychiatrist here at McGill, so **PLEASE feel free to PM me** if you have questions (before or after). Anonymity is often helpful.  

Obviously I don't want to share too much about my own case here either, but if you have any questions about my personal experience I'd be happy to share more of that as well. 

The only suggestions I would make are as follows:

 - Be as honest with them as you are comfortable with. If there's something that you feel is relevant, then don't just skip over it. If you don't want to mention, for example, that your sibling died of cancer and it was a long painful process that brought down your grades, social life, blah blah blah, then at least try to say ""I lost a loved one and it really impacted my life"" or something like that. If they have at least a vague idea, that really helps them. Also, if you're nervous or don't want to talk about something or share further details, then just say so, for example ""I've been all stressed out about coming here"" or ""I'd prefer not to talk about that any further"". 

 - If they refer you to psychiatry and you get landed with Dr. Franck, you might want to ask to see someone else. 

Again, fee free to message me with any questions. "
241,7qpsps,"Dont cancel your appointment. I went because my depression got bad. Its helpful, definitely even more helpful if you straight up ask for a different person if yours isnt helping you (they wont be offended i promise!). Only thing is health services is v overstrapped so your next meeting wont be for a few weeks. Thats what got me really. I started going because I was referred from a hospital for being suicidal, and at my extreme state the best they could do was every 2 weeks then every month.  Id feel better after the meeting but having to wait a month caused a lack of progress. 

But they help, really. One thing that struck me in my first meeting was being told ""you dont have to live like this"". Because you dont, and you get so used to carrying all ur shit that you dont realize that its possible to live without it. "
242,7qpsps,"Thank you so much for taking the time and giving me such a detailed response. It means a lot and it's kind of calmed my nerves a bit to know sort of questions that'll be asked and things to write down before the appointment so I know what to mention so I don't forget that I experienced or tried something. 😊

I'm sort of an over prepared type of person with everything, even when it comes to just going somewhere for fun I either need someone with me or a description of what I'm supposed to do/expect 😹😹 

It took me a long time to get the nerve to make the appointment so I'm glad that I have this response now to help me not throw it away. Good luck with your semester 💖💖💖 and thanks!"
243,7qpsps,"Definitely second the Dr. Franck comment. Totally forgot about that. While my experience with him wasn't awful, the advice he gave was needlessly confusing."
244,7qpsps,"If you were assigned to Dr. Franck but it turned out not to really fit, can you just go to the Mental Health reception and ask to be seen by another psychiatrist than him starting from now? 

Is it something they are okay with doing? "
245,7qpsps,Yes.
246,63aiaz,"YES. thank you. I think what Healthy McGill and all other mental health initiatives strive to achieve is great, but unfortunately without the administration on our side with policies it doesn't help at all. 

Like many other McGill students, I've had final exam periods with 3 exams in 36 hours, and midterm weeks where I had 5 midterms in 4 days. That is *not* okay and even with over a month of preparation, the human body can only withstand so many lengthened periods of stress, it's REALLY hard to do well on all of them. I had multiple breakdowns last year because of the kind of bullshit I went through. And considering how much effort I put into the situation despite  how miserable I was, I can say with confidence that ultimately the university's inflexible policies were responsible for this. Hearing my advisor and Healthy McGill telling me to ""sleep more"" and ""take care of myself"" in these situations only got me angry because it didn't change the fact that I had to cut down on my sleep and work 24/7 to get through shitty schedules because I wasn't allowed to have an exam deferral and I couldn't have any timely psychological help.

248,63aiaz,"If one needs Mental Health services to get through university, it shows he/she is not mentally strong enough to cope with the stress that comes with being at a university. He/she deserves to be expelled or be on probation because it clearly shows incompetence. "
249,63aiaz,The fact that four midterms in two consecutive days is allowed is bullshit.  I ended up having to defer them because of a solid 5 days of anxiety attacks anyways.  Thanks ~~Obama~~ McGill
250,63aiaz,"The month-long winter break is what schools south of the border get to enjoy.

"
251,63aiaz,"so I take it you *don't* want to sign the petition.... 

more seriously, there are a lot of reasons why students may need mental health care during their time at McGill, and these in no way mean that they should be expelled or put on probation. "

254,63aiaz,"I myself have never used mental health services at McGill but I have to say this, there are many people who need them and there are many people who are experiencing situations much harder than your own. I've had friends who have lost immediate family members the week before exams, individuals who cannot get enough sleep because they stay up from the stress of not knowing if they will be able to pay tuition their next semester, international students who find it hard to adapt to certain aspects of Western culture and therefore are completely isolated in terms of friends or colleagues. Many of them still get very good grades in their classes and succeed; however, they do it at the expense of their mental health. This is not right. 

I hope your previous comment is a troll comment because it takes a certain kind of cruelty to look down on someone due to the possession of mental illness. Mental illness is something they had no choice over and something that often needs professional help to remedied or even mitigated. We are past the days of ""tough it out"" because we now, in many cases, have scientific data and numerous studies to demonstrate that ""toughing it out"" often leads to more severe mental and physical tolls. 

I cannot believe you went or are going to McGill where you are literally surrounded by literature, professors, and colleagues who are experts in these kinds of fields and yet you still act as if your ignorant opinion is better than that of the psychiatric community. You should know better. 

I want to make it clear that this comment isn't for your ego/a response to your troll bait, but more for anyone who feels bad after reading what you wrote. No one should be made to feel bad because of unchosen circumstances affecting their health."

260,63aiaz,"Probably a troll, created for the very purpose of down votes and drama. 



It would be wise to not engage. "
261,63aiaz,"May I ask what reasons? People get stressed all the time, if university is breaking you mentally then maybe you are not fit for it."
262,63aiaz,HAHAHA
263,63aiaz,"Suggesting someone take a semester off or a reduced course load is WAY different from ""you can't handle it and you don't belong here"".

The fact is many mental illnesses tend to emerge in early adulthood.  That means that students have the double duty of exploring what works for them in terms of treatment while simultaneously trying to succeed here.  That's why I disagree with you- if you are intelligent enough to make it here, then the university, IMO, has a responsibility to assist you if you are afflicted by poor mental health.  In fact, according to the popular idea of stress-diathesis, the university itself could be the trigger for the illness to develop in the first place.  We should be accepting people who struggle, not say ""well you made it this far but gtfo""

EDIT: also, the reality is this is most likely the most challenging and rigorous environment you'll ever face in your life.  We're not living in this fantasy world like you described, at all."
264,63aiaz,"You wrote it better than I did. Looking back maybe I was a bit harsh with my words. However, I think it is reasonable to draw the line somewhere. If mental illness is severely impacting the student's learning, I do not see anything wrong with telling them to take a break or withdraw from school until they fix their illness which I think is the same result as probation."
265,63aiaz,"Sure, I understand that there are extreme circumstances. It does bother me that some people are suffering from consequences that they are not responsible for. However, I don't think increasing presence of mental health treatment on campus is efficient in any way. If mental illness is as detrimental as you say, and university environment is responsible for it, why can't university encourage the student to leave and tell the student to come back after curing that illness with a medical expert? Also if this is reoccurring issue, I think university should step in and tell the student that maybe it is better to pursue other passion for the sake of university and the student. I guess people were upset at how I worded my comment, but I don't see any difference between what I just said here and probation/expulsion in terms of result."
266,63aiaz,She should read this. Shame on her for abusing an already extremely frail system
267,63aiaz,"tbh I knew deferring wouldn't be an issue because of GAD, panic disorder, and agoraphobia diagnoses.  But I'm losing 5 marks just for deferring (not transferring the weight, the prof is doing it weirdly) in one class, which is a stressful surprise.  

The services are great when they work well, and I've been using them long enough that they work well for me now (took a few years to find a counsellor that fit, a few years to finally be seen by a psychiatrist, etc.), but I'm one of the lucky few who *could* push myself through the process- over time.  A lot of people stop their help-seeking because it's such a discouraging process, they've never had to self-advocate on this level before, or generally engaged in help-seeking, and often the system is so overloaded that I've heard people are being told straight up if they can't set goals in their first session they're ""functional enough"", and none of that is okay, and that's why I signed the petition.

EDIT: I'm glad you're ok, also.  Keep that support system strong, and please don't give up on help-seeking in general, if you know you could benefit!!"
268,63aiaz,"Hats off to you for making it through that, seriously."
269,63aiaz,"I guess the problem is conformity, since most Canadian postsecondary schools are stuck to the two semesters of September - December and January-April, with a full 4 months off in the summer. Having one school go on a totally different schedule can be very disruptive when it comes to summer employment and internships. 

A third approach that is used by a few schools in Europe is three trimesters of around 8-9 weeks each, with around 2-3 weeks off between each trimester. With this system your 3 terms are October-early Dec, Jan-early Mar and April-May. "

272,63aiaz,"""curing the illness""

""For the sake of the university""

What kind of bullshit is this? You're really prioritizing an institution over individual students? 

Congrats, you might be the most obtuse, unaware person I've ever encountered on this subreddit. "
273,63aiaz,"that's still ridiculous that you are losing marks because your situation. You should definitely try and fight that.  I'm glad you have found the right fit for your care!! Yeah, one of my friends was straight up dismissed for his problems. Talk about a morale hit.

Thank you so much! I'm in a much better place now because I switched to a program where the teachers and students really care about me as a person. It makes a world of difference when you're in a faculty where people know you by name and holistic, low-stakes grading is prioritized. In my case, it was my first major depressive episode, and I think it was situational because it hasn't reoccurred, but I am still ""recovering"" as I am still slowly learning how to take care of myself again."
274,63aiaz,"I still haven't heard any good reason why I should believe otherwise, instead I have been bombarded with insults. I will try to read the link you wrote tonight though. Thanks."
275,63aiaz,"""For the sake of university AND the student""
I don't mind criticism and insults but please be accurate. Thank you."
276,63aiaz,"I was also addressing your first comment about ""curing"" the illness. What an idiotic statement, its not simply as easy as that. It is a statement that shows you know very, very little about the realities of mental illness. "
277,63aiaz,"Ok fair. I guess treatment is the correct word to use here. Also, I don't think I said it is easy, that is why I also suggested to seek professional help. I would argue that you do not know much about me to say the last sentence but you are entitled to your own opinion."
278,63aiaz,"When university is key to making a living wage these days, its not as simple as""encouraging"" the student to  ""pursue another passion."" For many, this is an intrinsic step to supporting themselves (as unfortunate as that is), not an example of a sport or creative pursuit.  Likewise, not everyone can just afford to drop out. Say a student drops out, and goes and gets a job as a mentally ill individual? If anything, the university is less of the ""real world"" than the job world is and reasonable accommodations should be made to help these students be well during this time. "
279,63aiaz,"First, I would say that university is not the key to making a living wage. There are many other ways one can obtain livable income. Minimum wage per year in Canada is around 20K to 25K. Although it would be tough to have a middle class life style I still think it is very ""livable"" income and it does not require any university degree. There are plenty of jobs that don't require university degree which pay more than minimum wage as well. 

I agree that people in university are not in it for a sport or creative pursuit. However, that doesn't mean university is responsible for the problems of the students and are obligated to cater to the student's needs. I believe it is university's duty to prepare the students for challenging problems in the ""real world"", including problems that will break them mentally. To achieve this, it is necessary for university to have close resemblance to what the ""real world"" is like. 

I too wish that I can live in a Utopia where everyone can be happy and everyone can get what they want without hurting themselves or sacrificing anything important but in reality I think you will agree that this is not possible. Some people are just not cut for a lot of things. Even if it is the fault of mental illness, people should just accept the truth and look for alternative ways for their best interest, whatever that could be. So considering your example of mentally ill individual, it is very unfortunate circumstance that can happen to someone, but he/she should not expect the university fix his/her problem.

If you were offended by my wording, I would like to apologize. I see that I was too blunt that angered many people but I just wanted to get my thoughts out there. 

Thanks and good luck with your studies."
280,6mk5t4,"beware of falling into the trap of ""getting over with"" requirements instead of taking an easy/enjoyable class each semester if you have the choice"
281,6mk5t4,"(if you are privileged enough to have the opportunity) Don't be afraid to take a semester off. If you're struggling due to lack of motivation, chances are you won't push through it by doing the same thing over and over again. Take a semester off to find your passion and work on yourself. "
282,6mk5t4,"Sometimes the best thing to do is just to listen and not to ask too many questions to a friend who's going through a rough patch. However, you should still let them know that you're there for them if they need support, even if you're not entirely sure how to help. It's also useful to share your own experiences if you have personally had similar struggles.

And if you're on the other side, being the person suffering from mental illness, it's really important to let one or two of your best friends know what's going on instead of keeping it entirely to yourself. That will ensure that someone's looking out for you and knows how to help/what to expect should you experience another episode. If you're experiencing your first ever episode, it's important to acknowledge that mental illness is often chronic, and even with the best therapies it takes weeks to months to see a noticeable improvement; during the recovery phase there will often be fluctuations between good and ""down"" periods and progress can be slow. 

I've personally had issues with anxiety last year which was bad enough to require antidepressants. I've not had symptoms since December, fortunately. On the other hand, I've a friend who experienced her first major depressive episode during the stressful midterm season, which continued to affect her early into the summer. I found out about this coincidentally when I saw her at the pharmacy while I was refilling my own prescription. Since then I've gotten to understand her struggles and my own experiences made it relatively easier to re-assure her that she's not alone and that there's always support available. At the same time it's important to maintain confidentiality, and hence only about two or three other friends (whom she approves of) knows the full details of what's going on. "
283,6mk5t4,"When I was going through a terrible time (simultaneously with my best friend) we basically lived together. To make sure the other one was eating, sleeping and studying, we would do it all together. Then, we would have sleepovers through the very difficult times to make sure we were safe. "
284,6mk5t4,"If you can't handle taking 5 classes a semester, don't do it. Summer classes exist for a reason (:"
285,6mk5t4,"remember that you can withdraw from a course past the deadline if you really need it with documentation and a good reason.

 don't be like me and take the biol 201 final, despite spending the entire semester mad depressed, and THUS YOU CANT DROP THE DAMN CLASS"
286,6mk5t4,"If your friend is struggling - when your friend reaches out, just listen and be present. Be cognizant of the things you say; if you don't know what to say, don't say anything. When you're struggling nothing feels shittier to hear than someone close to you saying ""at least you got _"" or ""why do you feel this way?"" or ""why don't you get a hobby?"". If you feel that you can't be a soundboard for your friend, reach out to your friend often and offer to go out to eat with them or to study with them, even if they say no every time; they might feel like a burden by reaching out to you.

If you are the one struggling - like others said, it is important to seek help and let your loved ones know what you're going through. However, although they will care and try to be there of you, some people, whether they be your parents, friends, or partner, won't be capable of or know how to properly support you through a tough time. Recognize that it is not their intention to belittle you or that they don't want to understand what you are going through; they do, they just don't know how. If that is the case, it's okay to seek other help outside of your immediate circle. Seek support from people who do know how to help (friends who have gone through similar times, Mental Health, Counselling, Peer Support Network, etc.). Don't neglect schoolwork and relationships, but it's okay to be selfish and put yourself first. You are allowed to fall apart sometimes.

Edit: I can't recommend counselling enough. I was fortunate to have an incredible counsellor I saw for 2 years, and it was incredibly helpful for me to set apart an hour every 2 weeks to reflect on how things have been going and check in on how I've been doing, even during times I didn't have any particular trouble in my life. During the tough times, she was an incredible source of support. I've gained so much insight into myself through the 2 years. You pay for these resources, so take advantage of them. I've graduated now and even though I have had my frustrations with them, I realize how lucky McGill students are to have the resources they have."
287,6mk5t4,"Make time to go out and relax, even in extremely busy periods. When surrounded by a bunch of people who are all stressing out, it's easy to fall into the same trap.

"
288,6mk5t4,"Incoming students; if you require mental health care at McGill, be sure to get a referral from your doctor in order to get an appointment with mental health. You can put the fees onto your provincial health card or Blue Cross health insurance in the case of international students"
289,6mk5t4,Nightline can be VERY helpful for venting
290,6mk5t4,"I'll try to contribute:

If you need help, McGill mental health offers hour long therapy sessions with good professionals that is covered the health insurance bill. They also offer workshops and group therapy, with the group therapy being more intensive. MMH wrote on their website that 1-on-1 therapy sessions would be available less than 2 weeks apart or an instant meeting only for emergencies (suicidal thoughts, delusions, etc). However, last year there was a clusterfuck of people who wanted to use it and that two-week promise eventually rose to 3 to 3 and a half weeks between sessions, which is not enough for many people. It's also the case that your first two sessions are only meant to acquaint your case with your doctor, and the first session for a psychiatrist is the same way. That means that in the past it could take 6 weeks or so just for you to get on medication unless you were dealing with very severe problems. On the bright side, our new SSMU president has put forward a great way of dealing with this: to allow graduate psych students to take care of these introductory meetings which will allow patients to get help quicker. She also did some other good stuff but I can't seem to find that information at the moment (someone help me out).

With that said, these changes have not been tried out yet what they have to offer at MMH might not be enough for you. If you need therapy every week then sometimes the only way that you can get it is to pay out of pocket for a professional. If you can't afford it then you really need to try to be assertive with your appointments at MMH. You can call back regularly to see if something has opened up between your then and your next appointment, and it sometimes works.

happy-tips:

exercise regularly. lifting weights can make you feel better and gain muscle, and cardio can help you feel better and lose weight. do scheduled breathing exercises and meditation everyday. go on basic supplements like fish oil and vitamin d or [check this sub out if you NEED to go deeper](https://www.reddit.com/r/depressionregimens/). create a sustained habit of avoiding last-minute prep and spread your work out more throughout the week. I find that it's best to stay on campus after/before your classes for awhile to get work done ON campus and to make a 'day' of your trip to campus, and this gets easier with habit. if you're in social science/humanities classes then do all the damn readings and if the prof is cool then show up at their office hours. will yourself to create a social life or [at least try to go to something that interests you](http://ssmu.mcgill.ca/clubs-services/active-student-groups/clubs/). get great sleep by staying away from blue light before bed and also by going to bed and waking up at the same time everyday."
291,6mk5t4,"So... Do you just go to your doctor and be like ""I want to speak with a counsellor""?"
292,6mk5t4,"I got one from my psychiatrist back home, but I think even general practitioners can give you a referral and they'd accept it. "
293,5pyynl,"If there's any silver lining, I've heard from a friend that once you do see a counsellor for a first appointment, it is fairly easy to follow-up, and he's seeing the counsellor every 2 weeks. McGill has subscribed to TAO (Therapist Assisted Online), an online tutorial-based therapy site where your therapist can check on your progress remotely. Theoretically, the software also allows for teleconferencing with your therapist, but McGill doesn't seem to have activated this feature.

That said, the general consensus about mental health services at many universities in Canada is that they're understaffed and oversubscribed, with the same long wait times and inefficiency, so this isn't solely a McGill problem. "
294,5pyynl,"This is exactly the sort of thing I was afraid about. I wanted to start counseling after I realized that the psychiatrist at Mental Health Services is just there to give me a prescription, not actually see how well I'm doing. I'm really sorry that you had such a shitty experience and I hope you can find some solution. "
295,5pyynl,"I am really upset with the scheduling for the counseling workshops. There's not a single one that I can attend given my class schedule. They'll write you a note to excuse an absence, but that's not helpful when you attend class to actually learn the material.

298,5pyynl,"Hey!

301,6fgo1q,"Hi fellow struggling student! 

I just graduated however I did use mcgill mental health for some of the time that I was there. I personally found them very helpful. You do not have a maximum of 5, they use to have a maximum that you could see them per semester however they changed that recently (though you should ask them because right now I'm having trouble remembering what the exact policy is.)

They have drop in hours, go right at the beginning so that you'll be able to get one of the appointments and then they'll be able to evaluate you. Once you have a therapist, they will not force you to stay with the one you are assigned should you feel it's not the best fit, they are very professional in that respect. I ended up loving my therapist. 

Congratulations on deciding to seek help, I wish you all the best with your recovery."
302,6fgo1q,"Just to slightly correct /u/vivimaze, right now there are not drop-in intake appointments. Only Safety Appointments are on a drop-in basis and they are reserved for urgent care (find out more [here](http://mcgill.ca/counselling/wwwmcgillcacounsellingcrisis) to see if you think you fall into that category). To regularly start seeing someone, you can call 514-398-3601 (more info [here](http://mcgill.ca/counselling/) on how the Counselling and Mental Health service works). Otherwise, everything else I would say has already been said! "
303,6fgo1q,"Hey, I've been in your position before. Social anxiety can really consume you, so I'm glad you're looking at help options. I've been going to the mental health clinic for a while now. The appointments have been very helpful for me, but I find that it depends on the person you see. 

I've had more than 5 appointments this past year but they've also restructured the clinic somewhat recently so you should check with them. I would definitely agree that long-term counselling is better, even if only once every few weeks. They also offer a weekly social confidence workshop and social anxiety group therapy every term which I really recommend. And if you also just want to talk about anything with someone, pm me :)"
304,6fgo1q,Also think about signing up to take exams with OSD. That has really helped me with my Anxiety!

307,65n719,"Hey! Yes, Counselling and Mental Health Services will be open over the summer, although some of the staff may be working less hours/taking vacations (and they will not be open on Fridays). Other folks are correct in that it might be a good idea to call now to try to get an initial appointment in May!

As far as health insurance goes, yes, you'll just need your McGill student ID and proof of your international student health insurance. "
308,65n719,"I don't know if they're open in the summer but possibly as they are scheduling out until May currently. Give them a call to set up a consult to pair you with a long term therapist and go from there. 

As for the payment, you don't pay anything. The only thing you have to do at the end of your appointments is schedule your next one or simply walk out if you have already scheduled. "
309,65n719,"hey there, I've emailed to confirm and will post on Tuesday when I get an answer but I believe that they will be open during the summer months. /u/hummusislife message me and I'll get back to you Tuesday!"
310,65n719,"You don't need to pay beyond your international student insurance- sign the form that they give you that says that you consent to being under Quebec law, and that you'll use the Blue Cross as your insurance provider. If you're prescribed medication, you'll need to pay upfront and you'll have to go to the Blue Cross building to get reimbursed.

314,4sxdyv,"Hey! I'm so sorry for what you are going through. That sounds incredibly difficult.

There are no words to express the sadness we all feel about what the global situation has done to your people. I can't imagine what you are going through.

I believe the suggestions below to seek counselling at McGill Mental Health is a good option. However, if you feel like you need to talk to someone immediately, today, you can walk into your local CLSC and ask to speak with a social worker. They will be able to listen, and also suggest other services that may be available. In the right column of this subreddit there are other contact info listings for services. McGill Counselling is different from Mental Health, and they have crisis drop-ins.

I would also ask: do you have anyone here to talk with, to hang out with? Would it help to speak with other people from your country going through similar things?

Feel free to send me a PM. You're not alone!

319,2ob506,"Hi,

my mind runs wild during every hour of the day, interacting with people makes me anxious and I think is causing issues somehow to my stomach, I have trouble concentrating because every 4 seconds it's like someone shows up in my head and starts talking about other things. I rarely feel emotions other than anger and am very irritable at all times. I have some OCD type of thing where I keep repeating the same few words inside my head constantly.

I have never seen any professional and am wondering if I should as I think I would feel too anxious and uncomfortable talking about what goes on inside my head.

If I were to show up to the clinic, how should I ask for help? Is there some type of diagnosis to see if I have social anxiety or anything what I described suggests? Can I just ask to be ""tested"" to see if I do have a real issue?

Any other advice? Thank you very much."
320,2ob506,"Asking on behalf of a friend:

1) What is the purpose of the requirement of a referral from another physician in order to see a psychiatrist at McGill Mental Health? This adds an extra level of stress and inconvenience for people trying to seek help.

2) What was the reasoning behind the Wellness Portal, in particular the triage survey? It seems dangerous and unethical to have a computer program sort patients by symptom severity. What steps will be put in place to prevent this system from being abused?"
321,2ob506,"Hi Dr. Low! Thanks for doing this AMA! I have a couple questions, don't have to answer all, but this is what I can think of right now!

1) with the increased mental health awareness and campaigning that has been done this year, has there been an increase in traffic at the clinic? How has it been able to handle this?

2) What is the difference between counselling and the mental health clinic? Sometimes when others ask me about mental health services at McGill, I'm not sure if it would be better to refer them to counselling or to the clinic.

3) As a bystander/friend to someone who may be going through an anxiety attack (perhaps after clinic hours), what would be some tips to help the person through the situation?

Thank you!"

323,2ob506,"As someone working inside McGill mental health, what do you identify as key areas that need improvement? What challenges are currently being faced? What is the plan for improvement and responding to these challenges? And lastly, what is the vision for the future of McGill mental health?"
324,2ob506,Do you have any plans to eventually make CBT available at McGill instead of having to go elsewhere? 
325,2ob506,"Hi,

I have used your services many times and I have to say that I am rather disappointed in it. 

Before I explain what I am displeased with, I just want to say that the actual professionals are excellent at what they do. They are extremely helpful and have helped me in the short run, but I do have a problem with the atmosphere surrounding the way counselling is done. I am aware that you have a massive amount of students that require help, but a simple idea that comes to mind is ""quality over quantity"".

When I visited, I was told that I have a total of only 5 sessions with someone. First of all, it takes maybe 5 sessions (usually more) to even scrape the service of any psychological problem someone may be having. Second of all, this gives the service an atmosphere of ""oh, you're 5 sessions are up, you should be better now."" 

Along with this atmosphere, I found the counselors/therapists tried to get the students to feel that they are ""better"" within a short period of time. It takes months, maybe years to feel even remotely ""better"" from a mental issue. Maybe because these professionals are not doing a private practice and and instead, are working for an institution, this is why they must push students out, efficiently. However, this creates an environment of ""get the student out the door as fast as possible."" However, like I said above, the the therapists do know what they are doing, but I am unsure if they are aware that this is happening to students. Personally, I was seeing someone regularly at Mental Health but I eventually was pushed out and was convinced that I am ready to face my mental issue, on my own, after seeing this person for maybe 2 months. Unfortunately, I was not ready and I was hit harder than ever soon after.

Anyways, my experience with the mental health services at McGill was unsatisfactory. The actual counselling was helpful but the environment that come with the service creates an atmosphere that is not helpful for someone who is dealing with a serious mental problem. 

I do not know if this has changed in the past year and a half but since that time, I have been seeing a private practice. 

Edit: I noticed a part of a response that stood out to me and I feel this elaborates further on why McGill Mental Health creates this atmosphere. Quoted: ""Our vision of Mental Health Service going forward is to maintain a student-centered perspective. To do so, we will simply need to be better, faster, more innovative."" I am specifically looking at the word, ""faster"". Mental issues usually cannot be solved ""faster"". The majority of them take time and effort from the patient and therapist, time that can take months to even years. ""Innovative"" and ""better"", I agree wth, but ""faster"" is not something I would ever want from any mental health service. 

Edit: I changed the word regulations to something more suited.

326,2ob506,Something that troubles me is that I can think of four friends of mine (and myself actually) that have sought help mental health and anxiety problems. Most of these problems are school related. What steps do you think the university and students should take to reduce this?
327,2ob506,"Hello, I am currently going through some anxiety issues. I feel dizzy and lightheaded while studying, and it is very hard to concentrate on my studies. My blood pressure has been a bit high recently, and I think it is contributing to the dizziness I am experiencing. What should I do, and how should I go about reducing the dizziness in my life?"
328,2ob506,"While mental health issues can and do strike anyone, statistics seem to point towards people in certain programs as being at higher risk to certain mental health issues.  Medicine has been in the news lately as one example, with medical students as much as five times more likely to contemplate suicide than the general public.  I don't have the numbers for law students but I know there's a similar problem there - and I'd imagine other faculties have their own particular metal health needs as well.  Do you do offer particular services or attention to ""higher-risk"" faculties and students?

I also know that the Law student association voted for an exceptional 50k$ budget last year to address mental health of law students specifically.  Have you heard of this, and is this something you can/could help with?

Thank you for this AMA, it's an excellent idea."
329,2ob506,"This is a really important AMA, but I have a bad feeling that [this](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/159/325/1262055260350.jpg) is how it's going to end up."
330,2ob506,"So that I don't come off as insensitive or worse, I'd like to start by saying how hugely important mental health is, and that Canada would hugely benefit from providing more mental health services for free.

Having said that... how do you decide what line should be drawn in granting exam deferrals? Surely students should not be able to just say ""I am feeling stressed"" and have any exam deferred - this is already not the case. Also, a lot of the social utility a university provides is evaluating whether people can schedule their time, handle anxiety and pressure, and learn while managing a high workload. To some extent, mental health deferrals obscure this evaluation.

So again, what ethical guidelines do mental health professionals use to decide when a deferral is appropriate, or decide that the student just needs to suck it up?"

334,2ob506,"Hi aergerger, 

It sounds like you have been going through a lot. Please feel free to come into our service as a walk-in. You don't need to worry about a diagnosis. All you need to do is to come in with your McGill ID and your medical insurance card and we will try our best to set up an appointment. As a general tip, it is better to come in for the morning as appointments do fill up. Our walk-in hours start at 9 am, and are available Monday to Friday. 

- Dr. Low"
335,2ob506,"Hello, 

1)  Within a stepped care model of health-care (the model used in Quebec), typically patients are asked to consult with a general practitioner (GP) first. This could be your family doctor or it could be a doctor at a walk-in clinic. If the GP is unable to handle the case, a referral is then made to a psychiatrist (or to another specialist if the problem is non-psychological). There are several reasons to for this. First, many classes of psychiatric symptoms can also be caused by physical health conditions (ex., hypothyroidism causing depressive symptoms) and should have been ruled out before a first visit to a psychiatrist. Second, a GP may be able to treat the problem directly if it is not too complicated and this prevents an overload of cases on psychiatrists. At our clinic, depending on the particular psychiatrist, some will be more insistent on the student having been seen first by a general practitioner. Of course, if the case seems very urgent we may waive the need for a referral. 

2) The portal currently in development aims to provide an option to reach out to students who may be suffering but who are not comfortable to seek mental health help. Sadly, it remains the case that the majority of individuals with treatable mental health problems remain untreated. Some factors identified by researchers to explain why individuals who are suffering do not seek help include a tendency to minimize their own symptoms and a belief that their problems are not serious enough to deserve attention. The website aims to counter these beliefs by educating students about mental health and by opening up a dialogue to counter stigma. Stigma is frequently accompanied by a fear of talking about symptoms which can then prevent a real discussion of what may be a very treat-able mental illness. Even more importantly, the website aims to provide a comprehensive list of mental health resources and other similar initiatives to start people on the process of getting better.
 
The screening tool on the website is not a novel computer program. Rather it is a widely used and accepted questionnaire (the Patient Health Questionnaire or PHQ) already available and used in thousands of psychiatrists and psychologists offices across the world. The tool is not intended for universal screening for all students, nor is it intended to be mandatory for anyone to complete. We have simply digitized the questionnaire so that students don't have to print it out and do it by hand.  Even the guidelines for scoring the questionnaire are available online and are free to access.

The questionnaire does not offer a diagnosis or comprehensive assessment. Rather it gives very general feedback based on the results using established guidelines which are non-controversial. The results are also matched with suggestions for resources that are specifically available to McGill students, such as McGill Mental Health Service, Counselling Service, Peer Support Network and other student-run resources.  There is no severity scale that is part of the PHQ. It screens for several very common mental health problems: depression, anxiety, disordered eating and substance misuse.

Thank you for your question. 

-Dr. Low"
336,2ob506,Went to the walk in clinic to get a referral and the g.p was really confused as to why I had to go see him for one 
337,2ob506,"Thank you for your insightful questions. Here we go!

1) Based on preliminary estimates, we are anticipating almost a 10% increase in the use of our service from last year. Our numbers also indicate over a 30% increase in the use of our service over the last 5 years and the growth seems to be quite linear. This is likely due to both campaigns that increase mental health literacy and a more general increase in the number of students seeking help. 

Our response has been twofold. First, we have hired staff and are are offering more clinical hours than ever. For example, the week of november 17th, we were able to offer 645 appointments (almost 130 appointments a day). Second, we are concentrating on making our service as efficient as possible. To do so, we are considering using more standardized procedures, focusing on group treatments, as well as investigating e-mental health approaches. We are hoping to get ahead of the curve as demand seems likely to increase for the foreseeable future. 

2) Thanks for asking this question. First, the Mental Health Service has psychiatrists, so if a student has been on psychiatric medication and has a question regarding medication use, referral should be to the Mental Health Service. There are no psychiatrists working at Counselling. In general, MHS addresses more severe mental health problems that may be longstanding or have the potential to become longstanding by causing significant impairment in a student’s life. These would include major depression, chronic anxiety, bipolar disorder, psychosis/schizophrenia, eating disorders, and addictions. Both the Mental Health Service and Counselling Service offer ‘talk therapy’ by a therapist. In order for a talk therapy to be fruitful, the ‘fit’ between the student and the therapist needs be ideal and this can take a few sessions to sort out. So when a student is wishing to engage in a talk therapy, both services are available to them and the more important thing is the student-therapist fit. There are students who have both a psychiatrist overseeing their medications from Mental Health and a talk therapist from Counselling and this will vary from case to case. 

3) Bring the friend to a place of safety and quiet. A place that is more familiar to the person is better. Stay with them and reassure them that he/she will get the medical and psychological attention they need. Tell them the physical symptoms (rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, impending doom thoughts) will pass even though at the moment they seem insurmountable. Tell them the panic attack is not damaging their body. Tell them to take deep, long breaths and imagine a relaxing, calming setting (e.g., their comfy bedroom at home where they grew up, a vacation they when on, etc.). Allay the specific fears they have (eg. I’m going to fail, i’m going to die, i’m going xxx). Tell them this will pass and they will need to rest for at minimum half a day following.  

I hope that answers everything. 
- Dr. Low"
338,2ob506,"So I actually contacted McGill Mental Health Service and asked them to do this IAMA. When we met I suggested that the AMA should be posted at least 48 hours prior to questions being answered so that people would have time to submit question. 

They haven't mentioned a time but I would suspect that you should be seeing answers to question Monday-ish?

Again the 48 hours was something I requested so if anyone has an issue with it blame me. "
339,2ob506,"Hello, 

McGill Mental Health has experienced rapid growth in the last 5 years and we now have a larger staff than ever before. I would say one of the biggest challenges is to create standardized protocols so that services can be provided more seamlessly and evenly. To that end, we are currently re-evaluating and developing better procedures for triaging, managing of wait-lists, and assigning students to clinicians to make the service flow as efficiently as possible. 
 
Even as we face increased clinical demand, it is unlikely that our budget will increase in the near future. In essence, we are being asked to do more and more using the same resources. The only solution is change. This might mean heavier emphasis on group therapy and the use of e-mental health delivery options. We are currently reflecting on how to do this but we do want to meet the challenge head on.
 
Our vision of Mental Health Service going forward is to maintain a student-centered perspective. To do so, we will simply need to be better, faster, more innovative. This is no small feat but we have no choice if we want to be able to face the mental health challenge of the next ten years. 

- Dr. Low"
340,2ob506,CBT is available at McGill mental health.
341,2ob506,"CBT is certainly available at Mental Health. Unfortunately, we are experiencing very heavy traffic at our service and the wait times for CBT can be very long (several months at this time). As such, triage staff will sometimes suggest that students seek treatment outside of the clinic rather than wait. It is a small consolation but our CBT wait-lists remain competitive with those seen in the public healthcare.
 
Wait times can certainly be frustrating. They are a big problem not just at McGill clinics but across the province. As mentioned above, the Mental Health Service is offering more clinical hours than ever before and we have consistently  grown over the last 5 years. Yet the demand continues to grow faster than our ability to offer new therapists. Innovation is the key and we will need to find new ways of delivering our services. 
- Dr. Low"
342,2ob506,"I don't think this is an issue with regulations, it's an issue of funding. I'm sure the people who work there would agree they need more funding."
343,2ob506,"Hi Woozer325,
 
Thanks for the comment! Typically, students are entitled to a maximum of 16 sessions per school year at our service. However, sometimes therapists will end treatment early because they feel the therapy work has been completed.  This is up the clinical judgment of the therapist though you should feel free to seek a second opinion. You are always encouraged to be assertive and advocate for yourself. 

I understand your concerns and certainly there is a role for long-term psychotherapy. However,  studies show that short-term therapy (less than 16 sessions) is as effective as longer term therapy. The duration of effective therapy varies with each individual. But for the majority of patients at our service (who tend to present with depression and/or anxiety), 16 sessions is recommended according to the current evidence on talk therapies.  

- Dr. Low"
344,2ob506,"Hello, 

This is a great question and one that comes up often. I would like to highlight three areas where I think the university community can make strides towards improving the mental health of its members. 

First, greater student involvement in grassroots efforts at prevention. Here I think students need to find inspiration from the recent Students in Mind conference (organized by students themselves to discuss mental health) or the efforts of the Peer Support Network. Both represent recent direct and dynamic attempts by students for students to address the stress of university life. 

Second, there is the role of Student Services like Mental Health itself which in my mind is to try to expand and find creative solutions to the rising tide of anxiety we are seeing on campus. As director, I want to see our service really listen to the latest research and new models of treatment so that we can try to maximize what we do. 

Finally, the university administration has a role itself in shaping policies that promote a humane and mentally healthy campus. We need to move past education as solely producing future workers towards a model which sees the campus as a place of self-actualization (the whole point of higher education if you ask me). 

Thanks for your question, 

- Dr. Low"
345,2ob506,"Also, I have been to the mental health clinic and they told me that it was because of my anxiety that I'm feeling dizzy and lightheaded. Is there anything I can do to reduce these symptoms? Please, any advice would be appreciated. "
346,2ob506,"Hello,

I am sorry to hear about what you are feeling. That sounds really unpleasant and I certainly would find it hard to experience symptoms like that. If physical causes have been ruled out, then you might want to work on reducing your anxiety. There are a variety of ways you can do so and it depends on how you would like to approach the problem. Some ways to do so would include CBT, a type of structured therapy, or talking to a psychiatrist and trying medications. If you want an approach that is a little less structured, alternatives include seeking support from the Peer Support Network or trying an evidence-based self-help book. A good book in this vein is Anxiety Free by Robert Leahy. I hope this is helpful. 

- Dr. Low"
347,2ob506,"This question makes very good points. Thank you. We did not hear about the law student's initiative but we applaud it.  Our service does not currently have specific services for different student groups. We have however been approached by different faculties to establish expertise in the specific types of stresses/pressures/difficulties that their student group undergoes. We are very open to this idea and have also met with student leaders recently (at the SEAMLESS meeting). Going forward it would be ideal to establish a liasion between faculty and student representatives of the different programs of study who have the interest and commitment to reduce mental health problems. Together we can begin to develop a core knowledge/competency of what stressors their students endure and how our mental health service can do to serve their needs.
- Dr. Low"
348,2ob506,"I am here! 
- Dr. Low"
349,2ob506,This is actually happening. This was something I contacted them about doing and they kindly met with me earlier this week. I requested that they try and submit the AMA at least 48 hours before questions were answered so that people would have time to see it and submit questions. 
350,2ob506,"We receive a large number of requests for notes each year and certainly this takes up a lot of our clinical hours. Currently, it is left up to the discretion of the individual psychiatrist/ therapist whether a student receives a recommendation for deferral or not. The principles used by most clinicians include: assessing whether the symptoms seem severe enough to impair academic functioning, previous history of seeking notes, and the clinician's best judgement given their experience with the student.  
 
The Mental Health Service will be soon aligning the policies of Counselling, Office for Students with Disabilities and Service Point in providing a standardized note for academic accommodations. The standardized note gives a recommendation by the psychiatrist/therapist and the final decision is still left with the professor/course director, which has always been the case. The standardized note is already being used at the three other services.

As a general rule, students who have problems and require the Mental Health Service and that may need academic accommodation, should establish a psychiatrist/therapist early in the year in order to be proactive. It is less likely, though still possible, that a note will be provided if the psychiatrist/therapist does not know the student already.

- Dr. Low "
351,2ob506,"I asked them to try and post the AMA 48 hours in advance so that people would be able to submit questions and not simply find that it was already over when they saw it. 

If there is an issue with the time delay blame me. "
352,2ob506,"Thank you for your detailed answer, and for taking the time to do this :)"
353,2ob506,Thanks for responding. 
354,2ob506,I do hope you can get more answers out of them... there's only a handful of questions and no reason they shouldn't all be answered eventually.
355,2ob506,Really? They sent me elsewhere for it... 
356,2ob506,"Perhaps regulations was the wrong word to be used. 

I am aware that funding is a problem, however I do not see why this would correlate to an atmosphere of pushing students away to deal with their problems on their own when they clearly still need help from a professional."
357,2ob506,"There are lots of reasons. 

Some questions can be problematic from their end. They are also, very, very busy. 

Either way there will likely be another one of these in the future. This was just a dry run."
358,2ob506,I had it in house.
359,2ob506,"Knowing that giving more time to some means giving less time to others, what is your proposal? Who should get less treatment, and who should get more?

Otherwise, it's a funding issue."
360,2ob506,"If this thread only ever gets two responses, I won't bother checking out the next one. I think many will join me.

If they can't answer a question, they can say they can't answer it.

If they are busy, you know what would save time? Broadcasting the answers to these questions on reddit where tons of people see the answers. As I said, no reason."
361,2ob506,"Well this is why I am bringing this up. I am not demanding a change in the system, but to just bring attention to what could be happening to other students dealing with their psychological problems who use this service. I did not like how my situation was handled and I do not want this to happen to anybody else. 

Obviously, in a perfect world, everyone could be scheduled in and would be able to get the help they need, however this is not case or probably won't ever be the case. 

A proposal in mind would be instead of sending a student away with minimal to no skills to cope with their problems, perhaps they could refer the student to someone with a private practice who could continue to help. 

The fact that I was convinced that I was ready to manage my own issues without any help is what I have a problem with. If they had told me that this is something I need to continue to work on and to continue to see someone, instead of just giving me false hope, then perhaps I could have avoided what happened to me soon after leaving the mental health service.

362,2ob506,"Not sure why you can't just accept the fact that this AMA is structured differently, and was posted with the intention that people can ask questions well ahead of the time that Dr. Low is able to reply to them"

368,4zwmd8,"Hey! Just wanted to jump in to confirm that this is basically correct.  The health and wellness-related services in Student Services are working to create more accessible and available services, but it's happening in steps. Starting September 6th, there will still be ""two doors"" where you can access services (suite 4200 and suite 5500 of the Brown Building) but once you make an appointment or drop in, you will be meeting with someone from the new ""Counselling and Mental Health Services"" who will help get you to the right support, no matter who's delivering it, and hopefully with much shorter wait times. Services available from the Counselling and Mental Health Services include all of the services previously offered by Counselling and by Mental Health, including personal counselling, workshops, WRAP, support groups, and more, as outlined on the Mental Health Hub Website!

As for more info about the merger, full disclaimer, I'm just a student who knows how intimidating help-seeking can be, and with all these changes it might be intimidating at first to try and find help, when people in the services are getting used to the new hub setup, so just giving people a head's up.  From what I understand, they're integrating their booking systems with the goal of making accessing these services much easier, and removing the barriers currently in place (like only being able to use Couselling OR Mental Health, when you might need assistance from both in one way or another).  I haven't heard anything about changes in physical locations of the offices.  If you've had to use more than one service, you know how disjointed the flow of information can be, so this is a really, really welcome improvement!!"

Increased mental health funding was listed under a ""whereas"" clause in the [Motion Regarding the Increase of the SSMU Membership Fee](http://ssmu.mcgill.ca/elections/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Referendum-Membership-Fee-Question.pdf), which was already voted down by the student population. It seems like  SSMU representatives are picking a specific initiative from the previous motion to put forward in hopes that it'll get passed this time around. IMO this is reminiscent of when Katie Larson [wanted to hold a special referendum](http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2014/03/the-lease-is-a-disaster-and-should-be-terminated/) after SSMU failed to pass a referendum question to introduce a SSMU building fee."
378,4ackjs,"1. The motion states *""WHEREAS, mental health issues on campus require further support than what is currently available from the University, with 89% of students reporting feeling overwhelmed in the last year, with 38% of students reporting feeling so depressed that it was difficult to function, 53% reporting feeling overwhelming anxiety, and finally 7% of undergraduates seriously considering suicide while at McGill""*. Where did these numbers come from - how much of the population was surveyed? Would it not be more informative to say that ""Of x students surveyed, 38% reported feeling [etc]""?

I'll update this as I think of more questions."
379,4ackjs,"When we reached out to ASEQ for estimates of what kind of fee increase would be required to add psychology coverage, they provided us with estimates of several different options. To give you an idea, these estimates ranged between $25 for an annual maximum of $500, to $38 for $1100 annual maximum. 

Though I was interested in adding coverage near the higher end of that, the respondents to our survey were overwhelmingly in favor of the lower cost (with lower coverage) option. Because we can only put a yes/no question to referendum, we decided to go ahead with the option that students appeared to want most. 

I would note that this was the first year in many years that a Health and Dental Review Committee has been formed. Next Council, we are bringing a motion to make this committee a permanent committee, meaning that our coverage will be reviewed every year. In our final report, which will also (hopefully) be presented next Council, we will be recommending that future Health and Dental Committees look into how often the psychology coverage is being used, whether or not SSMU members find it sufficient, and what it would cost to increase the coverage. "
380,4ackjs,"I think that might actually be around average for a plan like that. I remember being surprised previously at how little the maximum coverage on ""very good"" plans was. Take my comment with a grain of salt though, it's been a while since I looked at it with any sort of depth. "
381,4ackjs,"Hi thanks for the question!

I understand the concern about this. The base fee increase campaign promised that a portion of the increased revenue would go towards mental health programming, projects, and initiatives. However, the SSMU Health Plan premiums are paid out of a restricted Health and Dental Reserve Fund (HDRF), rather than the SSMU's Operating Fund. So, even if the base fee had been increased, the SSMU would not have been able to increase health coverage without increasing the Health Plan Fee. 

The psychology coverage being proposed is very different from mental health programming. It has been specifically designed to provide professional help from any licensed practitioner to alleviate the long wait times at McGill Mental Health Services for the students who need it most. Additionally, this coverage has been developed over months of consultation and work with students, elected representatives, and the ASEQ (the insurance plan provider) - this entire process began in November 2015, before the base fee increase question was even brought forward."
382,4ackjs,"Hi thanks for your questions!

> Where did these numbers come from?

This survey was conducted by McGill as a part of the 2013 National College Health Assessment. As the report cited in the Motion states, ""NCHA is a standardized instrument that has been used extensively in United States of America and has been adapted for Canadian university students.""

> How much of the population was surveyed?

The report surveyed a random sample of 4,000 McGill students with a response rate of about 10%, or 354 students. This number is hardly a full representation of all 22,000 or so students at McGill however a similar number of responses is fairly regular among surveys at McGill and those conducted by the SSMU. It should be noted that both the Director of Student Health Services and the Manager of Student Assessment felt comfortable with these numbers in making their assessment.

Here is the link to the report from the Motion: [Here](http://www.mcgill.ca/studenthealth/files/studenthealth/mcgill_ncha_report_dec_2014_final.pdf)"
383,4ackjs,Central limit theorem? 
384,4ackjs,"Thank you, Zach. "
385,4ackjs,"Yeah, I've also been told by ASEQ that the coverage we offer is fairly standard for student health plans. 

However, one thing that causes our plan to be a little more expensive than the average student health plan is that students can opt-out of our plan without providing proof of alternative coverage. Most student health plans that ASEQ manages only allow you to opt-out or alter your coverage if you are covered by another plan (e.g. a parent's plan), and you are required to provide proof of this. 

Of course, the fact that our members have more flexible coverage options is great one the one hand, but on the other hand, it causes our plan to be more expensive because less people are paying into coverage that they do not need or use. 

"
386,4ackjs,"The health insurance I use (employee benefits) covers up to $2000 per person per year, with the same restriction on session price as this proposal. I also have all my prescriptions covered 100%, rather than 80%. "
387,4ackjs,Thank you! I was under the impression that these numbers came from a SSMU-conducted survey. Is it too late for the Motion to be edited to include the clarification you just gave me?
388,4ackjs,"I find it hard to believe that samples reached in SSMU surveys are representative of the entire student population, if engagement is anything like other interactions students have with SSMU (ie voting with only ~12% quorum that's heavily biased for and against certain demographics)."
389,4ackjs,"Changes in coverage such as these (increasing coverage from 80% to 100% for prescription drugs) are the kinds of things that I would like future Health and Dental Committees to look into. 

As I mentioned in an answer above, Adam and I formed the Health and Dental Review Committee on a trial basis this year, but before this, the plan had not been reviewed formally by a committee in a long time. At next Council, we will be moving to make this committee permanent. 

My intention is that, in the future, the Health and Dental Plan Committee will continue to review our coverage and provide avenues for students to let us know what they like and do not like about our coverage. If students tell us that they would like to pay more overall for the plan, and in return get better prescription drug coverage, we would be happy to offer that!"
390,4ackjs,"Unfortunately it is too late to change the text of the Motion, but the report is cited as a clickable link, so I hope anyone uncertain about that or looking for clarification and further information will check that out. Thanks for your follow up!"
391,4ackjs,">ie voting with only ~12% quorum

You will be happy to know that we increased referendum quorum from 10% to 15% last semester! Voter turnout is usually 20-25% for elections though. 

(Obviously, this is still quite low, but better than 12%)"
392,4ackjs,"regardless, even if these number were a third of what is stated it would still be pretty serious"
393,4ackjs,"Political polls in the US usually only have a sample size of ~800-1200 people, yet are considered to reflect the opinions of ~200 million. Nothing wrong with taking any and all survey stats with a grain of salt, though. "
394,4ackjs,"oh jeez, i just realized that was a footnote in the motion :s sorry for wasting your time"
395,4ackjs,"Yes, I completely agree that the mental health situation on campus is serious - my apologies if I wasn't clear about this. I just want the language used in the Motion to be precise in its description of how the data was collected and how the analysis is being applied. The fact that it was probably distributed via a SSMU listserv is enough to suggest that the participants are not representative of the student population."
396,4ackjs,"> sample size of ~800-1200 people, yet are considered to reflect the opinions of ~200 million

I heartily disagree, considering how each poll varies considerably in who the leading candidate is.

It would be much better if Google or Facebook could have a poll, since they could easily reach a larger sample."
397,4ackjs,"I'm just a bit concerned that SSMU has previously acknowledged that certain student demographics aren't involved in the voting process, but now is ok with saying that a survey that was likely distributed through similar avenues to voting that are ignored by the majority of students (who are also politically inactive) can represent the mental health situation encompassing all students on campus.

That being said, I fully support the improvement of mental health services at McGill, either by supplementing what already exists, or considering the inception of new services that are not offered."
398,4ackjs,">Political polls in the US usually only have a sample size of ~800-1200 people, yet are considered to reflect the opinions of ~200 million.

True, but political polls are often egregiously wrong (Remember how the polls in the Canada were predicting a slight Liberal plurality up until the day of the election, but the Liberals ended up winning a decisive majority mandate?)."
399,4ackjs,"The survey in question was conducted by McGill rather than SSMU. However a [Student Experience Survey](http://ssmu.mcgill.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SSMU-Priorities-Student-Experience-Survey.pdf) conducted separately last year by SSMU, which garnered 1,053 responses, found that about 54% of students listed ""supporting student health and well-being"" as one of their top 3 priorities, with 22% of all respondents listing it as their greatest priority."
400,4ackjs,"This discussion is now totally unrelated to the AMA, but if political polls were done over online mediums, they'd:

A) Only reflect the opinions of those who own/have access to a computer and use those sites, which is counterintuitive to representational sampling. Plus, there's no way to verify on social media if a voter is eligible to vote. I remember a couple days ago there was an article about how a huge amount of votes for Sanders in one online poll were discovered to have been submitted by teens too young to vote. 

B) Have to deal with self-selection bias (which is an issue that also may be relevant to the SSMU stats, depending on how they were obtained, but online surveys are pretty instrumental to psychological research, if the number of invitations to do them in my inbox is any indicator, haha). 

Yes, poll-based predictions can be wrong, that's what confidence intervals attest to. Any kind of sampling can be ""wrong"" regardless of sample size and variables, that's just inherent to statistics. There's also lots of research into how poll results often inform voting patterns, and not the other way around. The point still stands, however, that relatively suprisingly small sample sizes are industry practice in social sciences research. "
401,3tje8a,"I've been with them for almost a year now. Wait times are really long and sometimes the person who is assessing you doesn't know what questions to ask, and put you under ""not urgent"" when it is in fact pretty urgent. 

I got assessed and after a month and a half I still didn't get a call but my condition was getting worse so I emailed and called them and they finally found a place for me. 

However when they finally find you a therapist or doctor, you're pretty much followed there every week or two weeks. I can't say anything negative about the experience I've had there. They really help."
402,3tje8a,"Took over a month to get an appointment, which is completely unacceptable. Appointments were ~5 minutes long and I was just given drugs that weren't even fun. YMMV though"
403,3tje8a,"Get yourself on the waiting list now and in 3-4 months you can try it out and decide if it is for you. Counselling also is pretty similar and has a much shorter wait time.  It is certainly a long waiting list, and I've been on it twice.  Once you get a therapist, it's all about how much you like them, just like with any provider of mental health services.  "
404,3tje8a,"Hey friend. So Mental Health Services is okay, it's mainly where I'd recommend you to go if you're looking for medication. To be blunt, the professionals there don't really have the time or desire to talk to you about your problems (in my experience).

For that, I'd recommend you go to McGill Counselling Service. I've been going for a while and it's helped me a lot to just talk about my problems and what's on my mind. 

If you have any questions, let me know. I've been to both, and they serve their own purposes. 


"
405,3tje8a,I have had excellent experience with it. I was able to get a psychiatrist there quickly though as I got a diagnosis outside of McGill. If its urgent I highly suggest going this route. Once you have a referral getting an appointment with the psychiatrist is quick and after that making regular appointments was very easy. Same goes for a psychologist. First appointment can take a long time but once you get one you can make fairly regular appointments easily. 
406,3tje8a,"I had an awful time. He was an old man, and he said what I was describing to him was ""atypical"", asked me ""what I had to worry about"" when I answered his question of whether or not I was in a relationship (yes, I answered, and it was healthy), told me the cause of all my problems was alcohol, etc. and then told me drugs were awful. I just wanted to be referred to CBT. 

I have two friends who have had experiences with two different female psychiatrists and they get along really well/had positive experiences."
407,3tje8a,Thank you all for the replies!
408,3tje8a,"I went to them for a little over a year, it was my first experience with mental health professionals (I resisted for years) and I got a lot of value from it. 
I joined the waitlist in the summer so I actually waited maybe 2 weeks before getting seen for a 'triage' appointment where they assessed me and determined the best course of action. After that appointment I was set up with a CBT (cognitive behavioural therapist) who I really, really liked.
I got a lot out of my appointments there which were about 45 mins every two weeks. I genuinely enjoyed my experience; it helped me work through a lot and also gave me some tools to work through things on my own which makes a world of difference. 
This brings me to the point that a few other people have addressed; in the last few months I went there I got the feeling that my therapist didn't particularly want to hear about my issues which is unfortunate. Twice my appointment was cancelled and I was told that he would reschedule and he never did. The first time, after about a month I called and asked for an appointment because I know it helps keep me on track. The second time (a few months ago) I let it go and I haven't heard from them since.

Super sorry if this was long but I know that I like as much info as possible when going into new situations. Basically, there's no harm in trying it! You may wait a bit (especially this time of year), you may have to try a few professionals until you find the right fit but you may also gain a lot from it. 

Also, everyone here makes counselling sound like a great option. That may be a better option for some people, everyone's different! I'm certainly considering it now, thanks for the info guys!"
409,3tje8a,"You do realize that the city of Montreal has multitudes of other clinics. One clinic is not going to be able to service ~25,000 students effectively. While improvements should be made I think the clinic does its best to run with the resources it has.  "
410,3tje8a,"Not if you're an international student! International students have to pay to use any other clinic, effectively forcing you to use the McGill one"
411,3tje8a,Your point? You should just pay for the clinic. Your health (mental or physical) is worth a hell of a lot more money then it would cost you. It will cost between 50 and 100$ and you should get partially reimbursed. It works this way for out of province students also. If its a major emergency the ER doesn't charge either. 
412,3tje8a,"I think you're making this sound easier than it really is.

For many students finding ~$100 upfront isn't easy, and many clinics charge internationals more than non-Quebec Canadians. International students in particular might be unfamiliar with how Canadian/Quebec healthcare works, and might not realise they have options outside McGill. A lot of international students also don't speak French and thus might find the idea of finding an external clinic intimidating, even if they can in theory find an English-speaking one."
413,40zkn6,"Go to Counselling Services tomorrow for drop in.  You need to start taking care of yourself before you even think of addressing your academic record.

Plus, admins won't do shit for you unless the see a genuine desire and attempts to improve your situation.  And by ""doing shit"", I mean helping you work towards doing better.  Not wiping a bad semester from your record."
414,40zkn6,"You can do this friend, I promise!"
415,40zkn6,[deleted]
416,40zkn6,"Honestly, I needed to hear that. Thanks, I will go in tomorrow before my lectures. "
417,40zkn6,"I am taking fewer courses this semester, but yeah, I do need to make my health a priority. "
418,3rgqjz,"Look at the sidebar of the subreddit, a lot of resources are listed there :)"
419,3rgqjz,"If you haven't been seeing a therapist or anything and really feel like the academic stress is coming down on you, go to McGill Counselling, which is on the third floor of the Brown Building. They can get you letters of support to ease up your situation, and also will direct you to TONS of resources including one on one counselling, workshops, group therapy, stuff like that. It's free!

If you've never been before, they do consultations on a first-come-first-serve basis every weekday starting at noon, with registration opening at 11:30. Show up around 11:15 and you'll definitely get a spot in the afternoon (12 if you're the first one there) They also have urgent care starting at 9 AM and running throughout the afternoon.

Mental Health services are also a good resource. If you think a formal diagnosis and meds will help you recover, they're great. They have a waiting time of a couple weeks for an initial appointment, though. You can request an appointment online. They can also hook you up with the Office for Students with Disabilities to potentially get you some academic help for the future, like a note-taker. 

Despite popular belief, withdrawing from university for a semester or two won't really affect your degree, your GPA, your job prospects, or your chances of getting into grad school. I hope everything works out for you!"
420,3rgqjz,Go see McGill's mental health offices. They can help. The information is on the side bar -->
421,3rgqjz,"I dealt with severe mental health issues last semester, but I only sought help and came to terms with them this summer, at home once the semester had ended. I performed extremely poorly, compared to almost perfect marks for the rest of my time at McGill. 

I am doing better now, but I am still having a hard time coming to terms with the fact that this one semester will have ruined all of my plans and goals for post-McGill. I know this may seem bad, but I am wondering whether anyone knows if there is a way for me to go back and either put a note on my transcript or otherwise try to rectify the situation. Or does the fact that I wasn't able to face reality and admit my problems at the time mean there is no way for me to change this?"
422,2z1soc,"The other two replies here can't be serious.  OP, if a diagnosis of ADD runs close in your family and you have never been tested for it there is a chance you could have it. ADD has a heritibility component. Telling OP that he just needs more 'focus' is pointless if he lacks the cognitive resources to do so. OP I would encourage to go talk to someone about these concerns, although I should warn you that you may have to wait several weeks for an appointment if it happens to be a busy period. 

Edit: they can't prescribe you anything but they can refer to someone who can. 
Edit2: Mental Health services can prescribe, Counselling can't. Thanks for the clarification /u/yawnlikeyoumeanit 
Edit3: They can only prescribe medication if you meet certain requirements. Thanks /u/aidthrowaway2323 "
423,2z1soc,"I would recommend going to see them. but that being said, be warned...
They have a current waiting list (not for triage, but for appointment) of about 3 months. That is, you likely won't be able to see someone until the fall. They have drop-in clinic hours for emergency every day, which may be a faster avenue to go and see someone about it and just get a medical opinion.

I think a lot of people have this problem though, ADD or not. I hope you find what works for you, but do be careful about study drugs, as they are highly addictive.

additionally, install the computer app ""selfcontrol"". you blacklist websites, and the put on a timer for the amount of time you want to study and avoid these websites. it's helped me a ton, kept me from facebooking/reddit while i was meant to be studying. plus, you get to go on reddit as a reward when the timer runs out, and it feels like you've earned it."
424,2z1soc,[deleted]
425,2z1soc,"If you basically are looking for a script for meds, then you do not need to see a psychiatrist; a medical doctor can prescribe them for you. One of the more fucked up things about Quebec medical care is that GPs do a lot of psychiatric diagnosis and prescribing."
426,2z1soc,">I can't finish one page of a reading before I'm back on reddit or doing something else.

Come on... this isn't a mental health issue, this is a discipline issue. I'm sure you would be able to focus better if you started popping adderal, like anyone else, but you would be better served by not learning to rely on pills."
427,2z1soc,"Mental Health has psychiatrists, so they can write prescriptions. Counselling Services doesn't, so they can't. "
428,2z1soc,McGill Mental Health will not prescribe ADHD medication unless you have a full session of diagnostic testing and write up by a psychologist. 
429,2z1soc,"Counselling might also be an option, they can't prescribe but they are good people to talk to, with shorter wait times! "
430,2z1soc,Study drugs taken as prescribed aren't all that addictive. Drugs in general really aren't as addictive as horror stories make them out to be though. 
431,2z1soc,I highly recommend downloading Self Control if you have a Mac!
432,1qeu9x,"I think one of the main obstacles facing students seeking help from the mental health resources is the inaccessibility of the current services. The wait times to see a even a student psychologist for a 15 min diagnostic appointment are horrendous. I think the size of the clinic in terms of staff on all fronts (psychologists, psychiatrists, counsellors, etc) is way too modest for a clinic servicing a student body the size of McGill's. 
This is probably pretty obvious and the harder question is how to fix this. Basically I think McGill just needs to make it a priority and invest more money into it, which is why personally I'm skeptical the current system will improve since I doubt they will. "
433,1qeu9x,"The way appointments are scheduled at counseling is horrendous. If you've never been before you have to show up from 1130-3 for a first come first serve basis. When I went after going to the clinic they had booked up by 1230. If a student is coming to get counseling they're not in the best state to begin with. To make them line up on a first come first serve basis is pretty outrageous. There should be an option once the day is booked for students to be able to reserve a spot the next day. I can't skip all my classes to line up at counseling for the hope that maybe I get to see a counselor for 15 minutes. That's doesn't help someone who needs counseling. Presumably they're already there due to missing classes and can't afford to miss class any longer. The system is broken and does not work there.

Also the fact that mental health and mcgill health don't have the proper funding or facilities to have their own building is outrageous. We have over 20 000 undergrad students and all we have for them is 2 waiting rooms in the one clinic which could fit maybe 40 people max? That's outrageous. "
434,1qeu9x,"Push them to start a project that the Alma Mater Fund can fundraiser for. If any DAR reps are there, ask them what can be done to speed this up."
435,1qeu9x,"The Mental Health clinic could avoid focusing on exam/homework stress when advertising their services. It's become a joke - I've overheard so many conversations where people have said they got a midterm deferred by Mental Health because they hadn't studied. They feigned stress, etc., and ta-da! An extra week to study.  
There are students at McGill who need to see somebody but can't because the clinic is busy servicing people who have put off studying and are looking for a way out of their own mess.  
  
So: get rid of the ""Are you stressed?"" (and the like) posters. They're not helping people, and they're hurting the clinic's reputation.  
  
Good luck tomorrow."
436,1qeu9x,"I had experiences with Mental Health last year that were pretty bad.  I developed major anxiety issues last year that severely inhibited my ability to do basically anything--my mind felt really cloudy and I desperately needed to see a psychiatrist.  Due to the waitlist though, I had to wait three weeks for an urgent problem, which was horrible.  When I finally got my appointment, the doctor was just really unhelpful.  It felt like I was at a drug dealer, and most of it was either him seemingly refuting the problems I was having, or asking me what I think I should do to treat myself instead of relying on his degree to point me in the right direction.  

I've generally had a decent enough experience with counselling, although I will agree with /u/Not_Tom_Hanks that the intake system for appointment scheduling is ridiculous.  If someone has class around 11 AM, he/she has almost no chance at seeing a counsellor and setting up future appointments.  That's just not right.

As for solutions, I think they should definitely revise their waitlist system in some way that makes it easier to get appointments sooner (not entirely sure how, but if there was a way, it'd be a huge help).  They could also maybe refer students to trusted off campus therapists/psychiatrists to get more people help and lower the burden on the school's systems."
437,1qeu9x,"Put xanax in the water.

I'm only halfway kiding."
438,1qeu9x,"I had to go to the Mental Health Service earlier this year and i had to wait 1 month for a 15 minute appointment. in total since the beginning of this semester i've probably had about 25 minutes of time with professionals and i'm no closer to getting better as a result. 


The mcgill mental health services is frankly a joke. We need enough staff to serve everyone on a regular basis."
439,1qeu9x,"Part of the problem is that mental health services are inexplicably split between ""mental health services"" (http://www.mcgill.ca/mentalhealth/) and ""counselling services"" (http://www.mcgill.ca/counselling/)

Maybe consolidating the two would ease things up a bit?"
440,1qeu9x,"Bunnies and weed seem to work well for UVic, maybe we could try something like that out. "
441,1qeu9x,"I was at McGill during my bachelor 2 years ago. Did they change the system? I felt like the services were good. I was able to see a psychologist for 45min-1h every week or two without any issue. I also was able to meet-up with a psychiatrist on need.

I'm now doing my graduate degree at UQAM and there is no psychiatrist available and the psychologists can only see you for 1-3 times MAX and they are only there to guide you, they don't provide psychotherapy. McGill mental health services are the best mental health services I had in any cegep/university so far."
442,1qeu9x,Also the wait times for drop-in medical appointments.
443,1qeu9x,I will definitely mention that this is a project DAR should fundraise for. I'm sure they can develop an angle that would be attractive to donors. 
444,1qeu9x,"Agreed, during the Fall 2012 semester around 5 different people I knew pretty well got an exam deferred this way, or through a doctor external to McGill. Not one of them actually had a legitimate mental health issue to defer an exam. It's cheating the system.

"
445,1qeu9x,"I wonder if perhaps Mental Health could shift their advertising away from academic stress and Counseling could step up their advertising about their academic stress workshops (which run throughout the year, according to their website). Would that be a good change? I'm hesitant to say ""stop advertising"" altogether, because legitimate academic stress is definitely an issue and people should be made aware of where they might go to work through it. However, the exam deferral thing is absolutely a problem and there are definitely a significant number of people who might be using the Mental Health clinic for less-urgent issues, particularly around exam time. Thanks!"
446,1qeu9x,"Undoubtably there's going to be whining (by admin etc) about how McGill has no money. Apart from making mental health projects a fundraising priority, how else do you think this lack of staff might be addressed? Do you think expanding support groups would be useful? http://www.mcgill.ca/counselling/workshops/wellness"
447,1qeu9x,"My sister at UVIC tells me that the bunnies have been culled. :(

Weed's still good though. "
448,1qeu9x,"What I've been hearing for a while now is that Mental Health/Counseling experiences tend to be either extremely positive or extremely negative. Once you're in, you're OK, but getting past an intake appt. is difficult and time-consuming. Considering that there are definitely still existing stigmas for mental health issues and the nature of the McGill environment, any other barriers to access absolutely must be considered and eliminated, which is part of the reason that this is the theme of the meeting I'm going to. "
449,1qeu9x,A support group is no use when your issue requires medication. What we need is simply more staff; although even referral to other clinics or doctors would be helpful. 
450,1qeu9x,"I totally understand and sadly that's the case everywhere in Quebec. The fact that the health care system is free leads to crazy waiting-list time everywhere. Finding a psychiatrist in the public system ,once I was out of McGill, took me months and months and they don't accept everyone. They only accept the worst cases and if you don't call them back the day they ask you to, they delete your profile for ever. It's really intense. Finding help for mental issues is a real pain in Quebec. I felt like things at McGill were still much easier even though I had to wait 1-2 months at first to meet someone."
451,389nii,E-mail the professor and let them know that you have acute medical problems preventing you from writing the exam. Go as soon as possible and obtain documentation of your visit and submit it immediately. Follow up with the same doctor for the condition and obtain another letter of documentation.
452,389nii,"Rule of thumb is everyone gets one deferral without needing too much of a concrete excuse. 

That said, you can always get the deferral done after the fact."

455,389nii,"So, when I was an undergrad I was working multiple jobs, with fucked hours (at one point on weekends I was working for customs at  6:30 am and bartending until 2-3 am....)... also taking ritalin which fucks with your sleep. Always have trouble getting to  sleep and needed every second of it...

I used to keep a bottle of red wine beside my bed... get ready for bed, get into bed, slam like half a glass of wine and then 10-15 minutes later when you get a wave of tired... go to sleep immediately.... if it doesn't work apply more wine. "
456,389nii,dude don't be a jackass
457,389nii,Whoa how is that being a jack ass?
458,2gi80a,"$6 sounds like a bargain, seems promising. "
459,2gi80a,awesome! definitely going to that. 
460,3g6c10,"I live in Verdun, you can just take the green line and a bus from Station De L'Eglise.  Would take about 30 minutes from downtown."
461,3g6c10,"I've tried both the Monk and De L'Église routes. The De L'Église —> bus (58, which stops right in front of the Douglas) is a bit quicker, in my experience. And it has the added bonus of being a more pleasant walk; you get off the bus where there's a nice view of the Saint Laurent river, and you pass by a big lawn, trees and garden sculptures when walking to the Douglas pavilions."
462,3g6c10,"Metro to monk + 10-15 min walk, shorter if you catch a bus on the walk"
463,3g6c10,"You can also take bus 108 from Atwater metro all the way to the end (Boulevard Lasalle, Douglas Institute). Google Map can help in this case."
464,3g6c10,"Thanks, I'm probably gonna take this route! There was a lot of suggestions on Google maps and I was wondering what people chose to take. "
465,3g6c10,I took this exact route today and I never thought the walk would be so nice. 
466,2kkcn0,"Their mental health is definitely at least as important as (if not more so than) school, so if they need to take that time for themselves then it is definitely possible to drop all or most of their classes. That said, it is still probably important to consider what the repercussions will be in terms of transcripts, delaying graduation etc. 

I second going to see their faculty advisor, but I think first or at least at the same time they should go to Counselling or Mental Health if they haven't already to discuss the issues with them and come up with a strategy. Counselling/MH will also be able to provide written documentation for the faculty advisor if necessary."
467,2kkcn0,"I would highly suggest that your friend see their faculty advisor to discuss the options. At one point I was considering this myself, and I found them to be really helpful. It is definitely possible. "
468,2kkcn0,"I might be wrong, but if your friend is an international student from a country that does not allow entry into Canada without a visa, your friend's student visa will only be valid when taking at least 12 credits (deemed full-time student, going below 12 credits a semester will be deemed part-time, and student visa will work differently then). But if your friend is an EU or US citizen, for example, your friend is fine cause he/she is allowed to stay in the country without a student visa. Best of luck to your friend, hope he/she finds the help needed."
469,2kkcn0,"I'd say they should speak to their faculty advisor and talk about the repercussions of having several W on their transcript. They will also probably tell your friend that they need to provide some kind of proof, I think, or reason as to why they are dropping their courses at this point in the semester. 

In any case they should definitely go see their faculty advisor as soon as possible, since the withdraw deadline was like two weeks ago, and speak to someone at service point afterwards. "
470,2kkcn0,"Also, encourage them to look into options other than McGill Mental Health Services.  They might have insurance that covers them seeing a psychologist outside McGill, and that might be more comfortable and faster (for getting them someone to talk to and maybe a prescription if they need one).  They still certainly need to talk to McGill Health Services for the ""proof"" McGill might need to drop a lot of courses."
471,2kkcn0,Thanks for the tips. I convinced them to go see counselling services and talk to the department advisor. So hopefully he's getting it resolved. 
472,2kkcn0,"> talk about the repercussions of having several W on their transcript

Just want to say, while this is important information, if there is a mental health crisis going on, there are more important things at hand to discuss with a faculty advisor, and there is no shame with your mental health and not your transcript being the focus of the conversation.

EDIT:  yes, even if you're trying for med school"
473,2kkcn0,"if you have the SSMU international insurance this is covered FYI (you do need a referral for a psychiatrist, but mental health can do the intake and give you one)"
474,2kkcn0,"Yeah I wasn't trying to imply that their mental health wasn't important, so sorry if it came out that way. "
475,2kkcn0,No it didn't. I appreciate the insights. They're scared about having too many W biut they are applying to a master of arts. 
476,2fb9tl,"I got great service. Followed up with a family physician during my entire degree, got physicals, and was given the referral to see a specialist.

I also used the drop in clinic once, was triaged appropriately, and had a nurse help me out. A follow up doctor appointment was booked and all was well.

I've had a lot of blood tests done around town (various CLSCs, hospitals, and McGill) and I had the best experiences at McGill.

Mental health was phenomenal and gave me the tools to deal with my longstanding anxiety issues. Fairly easy to deal with once you're in the system.

I'll agree that booking an appointment with Health Services is annoying. The counter staff are also quite rude. 

"
477,2fb9tl,"Here's the thing- it's a system, and just like any other system with lots of users who have an extremely wide variety of different needs, there are rules to ensure ease of access for all.  It might be tricky to navigate through the services at first, but they can be accessed by those who need it and they do help people here.  Also, it's tough to address the nature of your complaint without knowing specifics (""poorly funded and run"" is a poorly argued point), and this is really not the type of thing you ask for specifics for.

Anecdotally, I'm from Ontario, and I've used both services, I've gone through a couple of counsellors at this point (yay interns and mat leave), some were better than others, and overall it's made an undeniable difference in my life for the better.

Try drop in at Counselling Services if the matter is urgent- get there ASAP in the morning, because like every other walk in clinic the spots fill up early.  Otherwise, you'll have to ask for intake at either service, you'll be triaged, and placed on the waiting list.  It's run like any other non-private health care service; I've only ever used OHIP/public health care, and the system here at McGill is no different from any other you'll encounter, if you don't have the cash to shell out for an appointment immediately.

If you don't feel comfortable going back, I know SSMU is establishing the Peer Support Network which provides opportunities to talk to a peer trained in active listening and such, and they do offer support services.  If Clare S-K or Courtney A are kicking around the subreddit these days, I hope they jump in because they definitely know a lot more about it than me.  Also, there's always [Nightline](http://ssmu.mcgill.ca/nightline/)"
478,2fb9tl,"the front desk people at the normal clinic suck. they are amazingly incompetent and incredibly rude. that being said, the doctors and nurses are generally pretty good though i wouldn't call them generally outstanding. the issue is that there really aren't enough doctors around (though i feel like i spend a weirdly large amount of time with them for strep throat like i know how to take amoxicillin run the damn test and send me on my way)

i've had a good experience with mental health - their front desk people being the polar opposite of student health's (they didn't even make me pay when i had forgotten to get my new insurance card and just said to bring it next time) - but their issue is that they are understaffed and this is a systemic issue pretty much everywhere in the world but especially here that there are just not enough mental health professionals around. that being said, though, i started in the summer so i did the intake and started normal therapy within about three weeks. that probably wouldn't happen now, but i would still go now rather than later when exams start if you think you need it"
479,2fb9tl,Thanks for the reply! I'll try some of the stuff you mentioned. I'm from BC which makes it difficult to get treated in Quebec without paying upfront and in a timely fashion
480,2fb9tl,"Dude are you high. Nearly every place I have been *but* McGill Health is a pain in the ass. 

A few months ago I had a rare infection. On morphine for pain, and because of the weird infection the morphine does nothing. Had 3 medical appointments in 3-4 days because I was fucked. For the third appointment I go in because I'm under crazy pain and I'm out of morphine. The #$%@ at Westmount Square gives me pain killers for fucking arthritis that take 2 weeks to kick in, a ridiculously mild antibiotic (which i've already been on 2-3 antibiotics so clearly this is dumb), and an anti-inflammatory. Then gets me a specialist treatment for 2 weeks later... I'm bleeding out my ear. 

Two days later I go into McGill Health, fucking dying. One of the people there walks by me in the hall where I'm waiting, my eyes are closed I'm not being a baby or anything, takes one look at me... pulls me in an hour early, has me lie down, they help me fill out my forms... Tomlinson who is awesome sees me before they even open and gets me a specialist treatment a few hours....

Specialist says every single clinic visit should have been to an emergency room (I blew $400 in upfront fees for non-mcgill visits, $20 on the one mcgill set up). 

TL;DR - McGill Health is awesome. Seriously show up at 7:45 most of the time and you'll have an appointment and be out by 9:15 (except for during exams when the undergrads as ""sick"".. then earlier)"
481,1mct1m,"(throwaway)  
been there. even when i got an appointment, the psychiatrist was very eager to throw pills at me. thats fine, its their job. i was never informed of the side effects even when i asked and ""difficulty sleeping"" turned into sweating, heart palpitations, dizziness, and shortness of breath, which were reported as some of the major (common) side effects at the dosage i was prescribed. if you decide to go there you need to assume that you will not be informed about your medication so do your research  
  
the author is wrong about one point - 'Don’t write uneasy feelings off as nothing, because you know yourself better than any triage therapist. If your negative moods begin to intensify, leave.' part of the problem is long wait times and thats not going to improve if everybody who s sad goes to see a doctor. leaving mcgill (or school in general) is a last resort, not something that should be at the forefront. leaving, getting out of the routine, having the feeling of failure hover over you in the future is pretty bad. leave if you have to, and only if you **have** to"
482,1mct1m,"I relate to her story a lot as I have struggled with severe mental heath during my time at McGill and have had less than helpful encounters at the mental health services. What I don't understand is why even after her experience she recommends that students got there. If you have serious mental health issues that need immediate and constant attention please don't waste your time at the McGill mental health services, especially if you can afford to go somewhere else. "
483,1mct1m,"I don't know how to comment on the Daily site without a facebook etc. account, but just wanted to share my own horrific experience with them. Edit: I don't want to discourage anyone from seeking help. But just need to share something that has really bothered me.

I got the courage to go after 3 years of severe struggling and dropping out once and returning. The triage therapist saw me within the week, and said I would see someone soon. She didn't tell me ""we don't want to see you"" ""this place is not appropriate for you"" ""go see someone else somewhere else"" that would have been fine... she explicitly told me I'd be seen there. The guy at the front desk told me it might take a bit of time, but I'd see someone. That was in early **October**. I waited and waited. I visited at the end of November, and I was told by the front desk that they were busy and everyone was waiting. So I waited.

I was contacted by McGill Mental Health for a space that had opened in **January**, but the space was during one class that I absolutely couldn't miss. I pleaded for another time. They told me they'd  contact me 'soon'. I contacted them in **March**, and they told me I was on 'top of the list' and I'd be contacted soon. Finally in April I contacted them, asked them if I had an appointment soon, the woman on the line said the same thing again. I told her to take me off the list and she gleefully notified me that she did and wished me a good day.

I swear on every holy book every word of this true. 

To this day I don't know what happened. McGill is a big beauracracy, but I've never faced so many hurdles doing something. I didn't go to any mental health professional 3+ years because I thought my problem was not as serious as others. I doubt I will ever try again. But I do wonder: Why? Was there a note beside my name? Did this happen to other people? Why did they make me wait for so long? I've left McGill recently but I still get incredibly annoyed when I see any suggestion to ""go to McGill Mental Health immediately"". I tried. I tried to be pro-active. I tried to be my own advocate. In a strange way, I am kind of thankful because my anger and frustration and hope that I'd see someone in that 6 months carried me through a difficult winter."
484,1mct1m,"It makes me so sad to read this because I've had nothing but amazing care provided for me at mental health. I don't believe I would still be at McGill without the people there who have done so much for me. I just want everyone to take this person's experience with a grain of salt, and mine as well of course. If you need help don't let stories like this discourage you from seeking it."
485,1mct1m,"I went in for an appointment on the first day of school and got an appointment in two weeks. The triage therapist was very sweet and we went over a lot. They told me they would call me next week. I really hope this happens because I am feeling positive about my experience here. A big issue is that they do not have a lot of space. The therapist that I saw said that it was very possible they would refer me somewhere else because my mother has insurance that covers 15 sessions (which is understandable, I think).

I hope everyone that needs help is able to find it, but mental health is still so unmanageable. I find that the resources offered in Quebec are so difficult to maneuver."
486,1mct1m,Completely agreed... don't ignore your problems because you think McGill Mental Health Services is your only option. Go and see another psychiatrist. Go to the hospital. Call 911 if you have to. 
487,2xas0p,"Counseling services or mental health services? I have experience with both (CS for counselor/therapy, MHS for psychiatrist/meds). I don't think I want to go into too much detail about this. Counseling has helped, but it's been a slow process and you need to be willing to discuss things honestly and to make changes if you want to get any benefit out of talk therapy. Meds have helped, but it took time to find the right meds/dosage, and they are far from perfect. Please don't generalize too much from my experience, it's different for everyone. The best thing to do is to go to counseling/MHS, make an appointment, and give it a try. Don't expect too much and be patient. Counseling services is free, but there is a limit on the number of appointments per year. MHS should be covered by your insurance (and thus also ""free""), but if you are prescribed medication you will have to pay for it (I don't know how provincial healthcare handles it, but with Blue Cross you have to pay full price up front and then Blue Cross reimburses 80% of the cost)."

490,1aiuuf,"I don't agree with this but I think it is actually less objectionable than the average Daily article (though he still engages in some predictable administration-bashing).  By far the worst thing in the most recent issue is definitely the [commentary article](http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2013/03/drive-thru-democracy/) that argues against secret ballots because ""one is not accountable for their vote when it is anonymous.""  In their view, creating an environment where everyone can participate in democracy without fear of shaming or harassment is somehow a bad thing."
491,1aiuuf,Interesting how many downvotes this has without many negative comments. It's almost like people are downvoting based on the fact that Chris Bangs wrote it and nothing else!
492,1aiuuf,"if you don't mind me asking, what is it exactly that you don't agree with?
"
493,1aiuuf,"It seems like a lot of the things he advocates are the equivalent of ""awareness campaigns"" - they sound nice but don't actually do anything.  I would be more interested to see a study done on how effective the existing mental health services are, instead of just spending money on more.  I have had mental health issues all my life, and at no point did I really think it would be productive to talk to a stranger about it.  I think the services are probably helpful in really serious cases, but I don't know how good they could possibly be at alleviating general everyday misery.  I also never felt stigmatized for my mental illness during my time at McGill.  Granted, I didn't go shouting from the rooftops about it, but I didn't hide it either.  It's obviously just anecdotal evidence, but I really didn't feel there was an oppressive environment or anything.

The best thing McGill could do (in my opinion) to help relieve some of the pressure on students would be to make academic advising a more accessible and student-friendly service.  That would cost a lot of money, though - much more than could be raised by cutting out the administrative waste that certain people on campus like to talk about.  "
494,ae3qre,"Maybe it's a seasonal thing, brutal winters and work don't go well together for me. 

I found that getting a light therapy desk lamp helped me with SAD (seasonal affective disorder). 

You can borrow one for free from SSMU (front desk) and try it out, might work for you. 

&#x200B;

Alternatively, don't forget your basics in terms of taking care of yourself. Get adequate rest, maintain good sleep quality and hygiene, go to the gym or do physical exercise at home, eat nutritious food (cooking can sometimes be therapeutic), do something you enjoy (hobby/game/hanging out etc) at least once a week.

&#x200B;

Finally, talk to your friends. Sometimes all it takes is just having a nice conversation with someone about how life sucks right now and vent/release.

&#x200B;"
495,ae3qre,I'm no doctor or anything but maybe taking vitamin D supplements would help
496,ae3qre,"Mcgill can absolutely wear you down. The grind is real for real. You need to find your happiness and everything gets a little easier. I wanna say find something that energizes and excites you. If you can find someone to do it with, that’s a bonus. 


You are going to Mcgill and your future is bright no doubt. You’ll achieve good things in your life. Just don’t forget to nourish your soul and take care of yourself along the way. 

Happy New Year Stranger. "
497,ae3qre,"I sort of hit a slump last year as well wherein I felt unmotivated and just kind of ""ugh"" all the time. For me personally, it was because my course load was too heavy. The following winter semester, I replaced a couple of harder courses with a couple of bird courses. I got a 4.0 that semester, and it was easier than the previous two semesters as well, and that gave me newfound momentum that I was in dire need of at the time. Because my course load wasn't as heavy, I also wound up doing more activities that weren't related to school, which helped me enjoy other aspects of my life and work on a few hobbies as well. 

I don't know if that would apply to you or if your feeling is the same as mine was, but if you think it might help, then drop a course this semester or take a few easier ones and see if you feel differently in April. "
498,ae3qre,I definitely feel you. 
499,ae3qre,Yes
500,ae3qre,"Idk how many classes you're taking, but if it's anymore than 4, my advice would be to drop down to 4 and give yourself the opportunity to do things you hadn't had time for before. Things that are less tedious and repetitive than class work, things you enjoy.

Involving yourself in clubs and student government could take up a good enough chunk of time that you'll always feel busy, like there's something to do that's NEW with each passing week.

Intramurals are good place to involve yourself as well."
501,ae3qre,"The feeling won't go away, I'm afraid. Just learn to grind through it, even though it hurts hard as fuck. You're too far in the game to transfer, so honestly, just put some headphones in and fight through it. It'll be worth it in the end. I'm a U4 who never shed that fog that sets over you. It stays there and it sucks. But this is just 4 years of your life, man. People survive prison for longer. That's what I ALWAYS tell myself."
502,ae3qre,"Suggestions: 
1. Evaluate your degree, see how much you have left to complete.
Should be getting there 

If not switch ASAP

Take a class you are interest in. 

2. Um.......if it was fall I'd suggest u find a sublet for your apartment and change where you live for a semester.

3. Get in contact with old acquaintances, hit them up, your formal Rez friends, don't be shy. If they ignore you then try others. It's great to reconnect. 

Think about the future, if you don't like something about now change it, if you are fine with the future look forward. 

Love

505,ae3qre,"Where is SSMU front desk until the SSMU Building's back up?
"
506,ae3qre,"I find that those light therapy lamps pale I comparison to the real deal. If possible, try to wake up around 7 when the sun rises and maximize time outdoors/near window with natural sunlight. It's not doable for everyone but it's the best thing I've ever done to beat seasonal depression. "
507,ae3qre,"This. I was like this during my first year. When I went back to my sunny home country, I did some blood tests  and voila!  Vitamin D deficiency. "
508,ae3qre,I STRONGLY recommend anyone to take Vitamin D. I take them 2000IU every day and it really helps me with my immune system and my mental health!
509,ae3qre,I already take them for past 5 years. i do not think light is the culprit....
510,ae3qre,"i had tried that, but it did not really have a long term affect. it helped.... temporarily...."
511,ae3qre,"Not OP, but binge drinking always leaves me in worse shape."
512,ae3qre,"I mean it starts in the autumn as the days get shorter in terms of daylight. 

You could also try vitamin D supplements, it's no secret a majority of Canadians have a vitamin D deficiency which is also attributed to depression. 

Alternatively, you could try visiting a mental health counselor if it's disrupting your day to day routine. They might be able to shed light into your situation even if it's not really mental health related. It can help having someone be your soundboard and having them reflect what you are saying. 

There is also a peer to peer support phone/chat line [https://psc.ssmu.ca/](https://psc.ssmu.ca/). "
513,ae3qre,"It's in the same place! You enter through the brown building, go down the stairs, and go through the door on the left. "
514,ae3qre,"It's actually a surprisingly common issue especially in UG students. 

They've done studies on binge drinking at McGill for mental health / student health in general. "

516,afqzqu,"Step 1: Turn off reddit.

Step 2: See a doctor for recommendation to an outside clinic that specializes in this."
517,afqzqu,"RAMQ covers psychiatry (altho not psychology or counselling). I never had a good experience with mcgill counselling, they all sucked. Psychiatrists are way better than GPs for psych meds. Some of the psychs at McGill suuuuuck ass, some are fantastic. Make an appointment and if your psych sucks request a different one.

Im in the same boat with stimulants. Eat in the morning before you take them and if possible try to take the weekends off. It's rough, i feel ya."
518,afqzqu,"With regards to stimulants and appetite loss, I've found it helps to eat a real breakfast before/just after taking them and then, eat small portions throughout the day. That way you don't end up like a competitive eater at 10pm. 

Anyway, I'm quite in the same boat - it sucks but stay strong!"
519,afqzqu,"I had a great success with McGill's mental health service. The trick is that you cannot expect to get seen as a new patient during exams or the week or so leading up to exams. This is their busiest time and and they, like any clinic, prioritise their current patients in addition to coping with an influx of students wanting to be seen at this time. Most students who seek help during exams do not return to be seen at the start of the term. 

If you have been seeing a counsellor at CEGEP, you can approach mental health at the beginning of the term (ie now) with an email saying that you had previously been getting help through CEGEP,  you experienced a mental health crisis during exams in Dec, and that youd like to see someone to help you work on your mental health in order to prevent the crisis again (and thus in turn, they will be available to you if you do experience another crisis). This way you will be one of the patients they prioritise come april exams.

I've graduated now, and access to mental health even on private is a nightmare. I can vouch for the fact that the care I received at McGill Mental Health was really incredible, and they can help you to if you start being proactive about your mental health (ie before the crisis) rather than reactive (during the crisis).  If you have any questions feel free to dm me further."
520,afqzqu,I cannot afford most outside services. I also already have a GP who is working with me on and off. 
521,afqzqu,Not that simple unfortunately. 
522,afqzqu,"> Im in the same boat with stimulants. Eat in the morning before you take them and if possible try to take the weekends off. 

I do the same thing. It sucks during midterms when you realize you're slowly becoming physically addicted and you're so ridiculously dehydrated and your heart is pumping at a million miles an hour because of it. Your body absolutely needs a break. 

You can easily file a complaint against your psychiatrist. I did and they gave me an appointment with a new one within the week. "

526,9skdvt,"I feel like most people went for the meme. I think everyone at every college is stressed about midterms (some from UdM posted asking if the ""next one"" could be at their school).

McGill is harder than most schools, true, but I think the a lot of stress comes from the fact that most students (myself included) aren't used to being anything less than perfect. This creates this atmosphere where students post things like ""midterm grades are up. time to drink"" in class pages or say that they're doing poorly in a class because they got a 73 on an essay.

This isn't an easy problem to address. While mental health services on campus are pitful, there's a bigger problem that I don't know if it's possible to address."

546,9skdvt,I think you hit the nail on the head. Employers treat their employees like dirt. Most people on this subreddit are stuck in La-La Land so they automatically down vote you. 
547,9skdvt,/r/BreadStapledToTrees 
548,9skdvt,Jokes on you I got a 50 on my last mid-term
549,9skdvt,If you got into this school in the first place you obviously aren't a failure.
550,9skdvt,"Can you explain what exactly about this take is ""weak ass?"" "
551,9skdvt,It's because people are triggered by Marxism lol.
552,9skdvt,"My gosh, I bet this is not the most obscure sub one can find. Honestly, I'm not even curious haha"
553,9skdvt,honestly have no idea how I managed it
554,9skdvt,No
555,a3lqek,"Actually, out of all of my friends, I was the only one who did 3 years. I feel like doing 4 years is the norm since most people tend to take 4 classes per term."
556,a3lqek,most people? heck most of my friends and people i know are adding a semester or two with their 4 year program
557,a3lqek,Man I sure fucking hope not.
558,a3lqek,"Hey, I'd totally recommend going to see mental health services, those people can help out a lot. You could also see an adviser to discuss your options, it helps keep things in perspective and you may think of things you wouldn't think of otherwise (a semester abroad, a semester part time, summer classes, etc...). As for employers not employing if you don't complete a degree fast, well firstly I think that's a very rare case, and in many cases it could even be beneficial to take a year off (you could build a more diverse cv, volunteering, travelling, working...) and if they do care, well I feel inclined to say that that's their problem and you shouldn't care, especially if it puts your health at risk. Put yourself first, I find it's important to not fight these things, find help if you need it, and don't be afraid to let yourself help yourself. "
559,a3lqek,Just don't put the start date on your resume. No one will even think about it. I don't think anyone cares. Many employers think university is always 4 years anyway since it's like that everywhere they don't have cegep.
560,a3lqek,"The pressure to graduate ""on time"" is bullshit in retrospect. You'll look back on this and wonder why you were so unkind to yourself. Your health and well-being will serve you well in the long run, and you'll probably produce better work and forge stronger connections with the right people because of it. "
561,a3lqek,"Employers don't care all that much. I added a year to my 4-year degree - I took a semester off and worked, and did 2 part-time semesters while working, etc, in large part because my mental health couldn't handle doing full-time school and no work, and it's really not seen as a big deal. 

Also, I resonate wth the whole mental illness thing. I'm sorry you're going through that, McGill is rough and high-pressure. Do what's best for you, and it definitely won't be the end of the world :) "
562,a3lqek,"If your experience is like mine, you'll be fine.

I finished in 2016 after a grand total of 5 years at McGill, working part time as I went.
Only my finish date is on my resume, and I got the first job I applied to after graduating at a company with whom I had no previous interaction.
Since then I've interviewed at a few other places, and nobody's ever asked anything about my degree."
563,a3lqek,[deleted]
564,a3lqek,That's what I'm thinking about. I want to come back to university rested and ready to concentrate on my studies. I know that I am capable ofufh better but I can't do my best in these conditions. Thank you 
565,a3lqek,"My program was 3 years too (since I'm from Quebec), but yeah, most people take 4 years anyways since a lot of people work and a 5 class load is considered heavy by some. Take it at your own pace, 4 years isn't ALL that bad. 

Note: I did a 3 year degree and straight into my master's at McGill. Kinda wish I would take a break tbh."
566,9dekhg,"Go to McGill's mental health and bring your previous prescriptions and/or diagnostics! AFAIK, they're pretty horrible for therapy but they will most likely give you meds, especially if you've already been diagnosed!

Good luck & enjoy your first days at McGill :)"
567,9dekhg,Go to the mental health office and ask to see Dr Franck — he’ll get you a script for anything you need 
568,9dekhg,"okay, good to know ! I'll have to have the records of my diagnosis sent to me, but that shouldn't be an issue - I will make sure to stop by tomorrow in any case (little anxious, first time receiving meds of any kind besides benadryl, advil and whatnot).


thanks for the response :)"
569,9dekhg,My psychiatrist was super supportive and helpful when picking the right medication for me. He made sure I didn’t experience any side effects and would adjust accordingly.

576,7uazjp,"I believe it is the university that gives SSMU and PGSS their money. I could be wrong. Either way, the email still pats mcgill on the back for their poor mental health services "
577,7uazjp,"i got sent to a collections agency over an unpaid bill from like 3 years ago

i honestly don't know what it was for and neither did bell but i finally just paid it ugh"
578,7uazjp,"It’s really all interconnected — mcgill, SSMU, our university healthcare provider. "
579,7uazjp,"I agree and disagree.

My previous university provided next to no healthcare services to students, but they key thing was that public healthcare services were available, free and easily accessible, so the university didn't need to provide them.

Public healthcare services in Quebec are... not great. If you're out-of-province or, god forbid, an international student then accessing Quebec's public health services is difficult to say the least, and will often require upfront payment (especially the case for internationals). McGill has to provide healthcare services because many McGill students have nowhere else to go."
580,7uazjp,"No, of course McGill is an institution for learning and research. However, they still chose to ignore that their student body is a diverse and complicated one. The admin brags that they have *great* health services for their students — but then fail at every turn to properly support their student body. They refuse to mold and adapt and listen to their student body! I understand that the mental health clinic gets overloaded with students bc the majority seems to be plagued by mental health issues. However, it mcgill were to hire psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors that were properly trained and not just telling students there is no problem or they should take this random pill (happened to me and I found out later by seeing someone else that I was actually supposed to get blood tested to make sure the pills were not destroying my liver). There is more to my rant, but that is my feeling that I know is felt by many others. There is no support — I am a successful student with mental health problems that are being worked on with professionals outside of mcgill. Not everyone is as fortunate as I am. "
581,7uazjp,"You are wrong. They get their money from student fees, which are collected by McGill. McGill has no control over it."
582,7uazjp,uhhhh why do you think there's a SSMU and PGSS fee they aren't funded by the university
583,7uazjp,"Sure, it's all interconnected, it all has the McGill name on it. But if you're referring the McGill admin team as ""McGill"" then no, I don't think they had anything to do with that email."
584,7uazjp,"This completely misses the mark.  You are part of a group insurance plan organized by a student union, not by McGill in the slightest."
585,7uazjp,"I agree with your sentiment but it is not the goal of McGill to provide comprehensive health services, that is the goal of the Quebec government.  McGill tries to fill the gaps but we should never expect it to become a full service psychiatric and family doctor clinic, which it essentially already is.  

Push the people with the money to change, that's the government, not so much McGill itself."
586,7uazjp,"""If mcgill were to hire psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors"" what did you not understand in my point that mcgill has limited ressource and is not a healthcare institution? "
587,7uazjp,People love to shit on McGill / SSMU / QC without knowing who or what they are really complaining about.  In the end it just sounds tone deaf to complain about the funding of a service you don't even know the source of.
588,7uazjp,">it is not the goal of McGill to provide comprehensive health services, that is the goal of the Quebec government

I agree, but the Quebec government refuses to provide health services to international students so McGill has to do it.

>Push the people with the money to change, that's the government, not so much McGill itself.

PGSS is (or at least was, I haven't kept up with developments) taking the government to court over their refusal to provide RAMQ coverage to international students. Unfortunately legal proceedings take time and money. In the meantime, international students need healthcare, and if the government won't provide it McGill must.

If McGill doesn't want to be a healthcare provider (which is perfectly understandable) then it will have to face the reality that it will be near impossible to attract international students to study here."
589,7uazjp,"McGill is not a healthcare institution, but as has been mentioned, if you aren't from Canada, you have literally no other options in terms of where to go. If McGill doesn't want to deal with these problems itself, then it has to find a way to route students properly towards other resources, because currently, neither is being done."
590,7uazjp,"> I agree, but the Quebec government refuses to provide health services to international students so McGill has to do it.

What incentive does Quebec have to spend its own resources on non-residents and non-citizens?
"
591,7uazjp,What do you mean no other options????? We have hospitals like any other civilized country just go there and pay up. It's no different than visiting any other country where you aren't a citizen and therefore your taxes doesn't go towards the healthcare system.
592,7uazjp,"I really don't understand what position you're arguing from anymore. You say I should

>Push the people with the money to change, that's the government

and now you're saying the Quebec government wouldn't/shouldn't change its policy anyway."
593,7uazjp,"As an American, I'm entirely aware of the fact that money can be exchanged for goods and services. However, mental health care (or any) is extremely hard to find in Quebec. The waits for the public clinics are months and are extremely difficult to get into if one isn't a Quebec resident, and private is prohibitively expensive for those who might not have international health insurance, since the Canadian healthcare system is really set up to route everyone through the public system. You can't just ""go to a hospital and pay up."" Besides, is telling someone to institutionalize themself really a solution? That's all a hospital offers."
594,7uazjp,"International students at McGill are not just ""visiting"", we are legal residents and many of us are even taxpayers. International students in other countries, and even other Canadian provinces, can access public health systems on the same basis as locals. This is not the case in Quebec. Without McGill health services, international students at McGill would be left with severely limited access to healthcare that would require upfront payment.

I agree with you that ideally a university shouldn't be a healthcare provider. My previous university in the UK provided almost no healthcare services because the NHS was available to everyone. Quebec's policy of denying RAMQ coverage to international students is the problem; until and unless that changes, McGill either has to be a healthcare provider or lose all of its international students."
595,7uazjp,Yeah for the love of God I don't want to get to the point that my only option is having someone watch me to make sure I don't try to kill myself 
596,7uazjp,So non-international student should pay for international student to get healthcare because McGill is the only place they can access it? Are you willing to increase the fees of only international student so that they can access these services if McGill is really the only place where they can get access to it? It's fucking easy to say we should have more / better services everywhere for everyone but the reality is that every time it comes down to paying for it suddenly it's no ones turn.
597,7uazjp,"I'm sorry but you are delusional if you think any province in Canada offers their RAMQ-equivalent to international students.  CHA requirements state that you must be a permanent resident or citizen, which is why refugee insurance is handled by the federal government until they are considered residents. "
598,7uazjp,"your comments show that you completely don't understand how healthcare is set up for students at McGill who do not have Canadian citizenship. As an international student, I pay $1000 a year for healthcare lmfao and yeah, I can't go to any clinic in Quebec besides the emergency room in the hospital. 
My job also automatically deducts the same amount of tax a Quebec-resident would be paying from my biweekly paycheck."
599,7uazjp,"International students already pay for their healthcare - since Quebec does not allow international students to enrol in RAMQ, international students are required to enrol in a private health insurance plan specified by McGill. When I use McGill health services, the cost of treating me is paid by my insurance.

The issue is that even with this insurance it is extremely difficult to receive treatment outside McGill - private and public clinics do not accept McGill's international student health insurance plan, so (assuming I can get an appointment in the first place) I would have to pay upfront and then hope my insurance company will reimburse me. Even if the insurance company accepts the claim, they will only pay up to certain limits, and clinics are free to charge non-Canadians whatever price they like, so I will end up paying for at least part of the cost from my own pocket.

International students are basically trapped - McGill is the only place they can access healthcare that they won't have to pay upfront/extra for."
600,7uazjp,"And by the way, international students pay way more annual fees (compare 5k to 20k) than Quebec/Canadian students, so it's not like non-international students will have to do the heavy-lifting : http://www.mcgill.ca/undergraduate-admissions/yearly-costs"
601,7uazjp,"Every province and territory except Quebec, Ontario, PEI, NWT and the Yukon allow (or even require) international students to enrol in provincial medicare. You could have verified this yourself with a minimum of Googling, rather than accusing me of being delusional.

https://studentimmigration.ca/public-medical-services-students-provinces-offer-dont/"
602,7uazjp,"I didn't say you paid nothing. But instead of $1,000 are you willing to pay let's say $2,000 for a better health clinic instead of the one we have?"
603,7uazjp,"This is not even close to true.  The Blue Cross International Student insurance has coverage for private psychiatric and counsellor clinics.  I have been both on that insurance and on RAMQ once I became a resident, and it is completely false to say RAMQ is better.  Blue Cross covers MORE private services."
604,7uazjp,"Has your family been paying tax for the past 50 years to support this system and send their kid there? I'm just saying that every time you ask for an additional / improvement in service just think where the money is coming from. Unless you're assuming McGill is throwing away your money on frivolous expense which would be used way better if put towards the healthcare system you just don't have an argument. So my point isn't that the healthcare couldn't be better, it's that if you want a better one either you start cutting in other services or you start raising fees for the user of the service and there's no arguing that. You're nitpicking around my point on technicality without actually suggesting a solution. So what is it? Do you cut service elsewhere or do you raise fees?"
605,7uazjp,"With a fee.  It's not free healthcare, it's just that they offer the public healthcare as a private option.  Sure QC could do that, but it would look similarly to the Blue Cross insurance, which other commenters have pointed out, is a wider coverage that covers more private services."
606,7uazjp,"I already pay taxes to fund a healthcare system I can't use *and* I have to pay $1000 a year to access McGill's mediocre healthcare. International students at McGill are already disadvantaged compared to Canadians when it comes to healthcare access and costs, how does it make any sense to ask them to pay more?"
607,7uazjp,it depends on what service. i think for some private psychiatric you are correct but not going to a CLSC when you're sick or something. they will charge you more for no benefit and they often don't even know how to handle people without a RAMQ card
608,7uazjp,"Thank you.  Quebec tax is high for a reason.  We use it to pay for good services for our taxpayers and their children.  Just because a student works a part time job and pays a probably minuscule amount of ""tax"" into the system, doesn't mean they are a resident.  They are primarily still a student from another country, and likely a risk to leave the province as soon as they graduate.  Hence not giving them immediate residency.

As soon as they graduate and get a work visa with track to residency, they can get RAMQ, because they have proven their intent to stay in QC and pay into the system that they benefit from.  The system works well for those who actually pay into it."
609,7uazjp,"Example : http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/pension-paid-to-mcgills-former-principal-rankles-employees  
"
610,7uazjp,">With a fee.

I can't be bothered to look up the details of every single province, but from the summary table I linked to it appear BC is the only province to charge a fee.

>Sure QC could do that, but it would look similarly to the Blue Cross insurance, which other commenters have pointed out, is a wider coverage that covers more private services.

You're missing the point here. You are right that Blue Cross covers some private services that RAMQ doesn't, that's not the issue. The issue that this whole thread has been about is whether McGill should or should not be providing healthcare services. The reason McGill needs to provide healthcare services is (partly) because international students have nowhere else to go - I can't use my Blue Cross card at a CLSC. If I had RAMQ I could access Quebec's public clinics in the same manner as any other Quebec resident, and would have no need of a McGill clinic."
611,7uazjp,"International students are disadvantaged compared to Canadians because they did not grow up with parents paying into the system.  Let me go to your country and try to access free healthcare and see how that goes. With the exception of very few European countries, I won't have any better luck than you."
612,7uazjp,"YOU CAN USE YOUR BLUE CROSS CARD AT ANY PRIVATE OR PUBLIC CLINIC

And additionally all CLSCs take private insurance, because they are a public clinic and are required to.  McGill forces you to get the blue cross insurance so that both public and private healthcare facilities can deal with you, and McGill doesn't need to open a full service hospital to meet every students needs.

You are confusing yourself into a hole:  You have PRIVATE insurance that enables you to access both PUBLIC and PRIVATE services.  I as a QC resident have public insurance that enables me to only go to public services.  You're complaining about better care, which, yes, you must pay for, because you are not from here."
613,7uazjp,"In my country, the UK, international students are given full access to the National Health Service for a maximum fee of £150 per year, and for many international students the fee is £0."
614,7uazjp,">YOU CAN USE YOUR BLUE CROSS CARD AT ANY PRIVATE OR PUBLIC CLINIC

Got a source for that? According to McGill, most nearby CLSCs only accept RAMQ, or at best they accept RAMQ and other provincial medicare cards (for which there is often a charge): http://www.mcgill.ca/studenthealth/see-doctor/offcampus"
615,7uazjp,"That's a great system, but we're talking about in Canada."
616,7uazjp,"You may be right for CLSCs, as I can't find a page for information about paying out of pocket (which blue cross would then reimburse).  I know the CLSC I worked at (Benny Farm) had the ability to just take a credit card for someone who lost/doesnt have/refused to give RAMQ.  

Private clinics are covered at 100% with the blue cross insurance, and for that I do have a source: https://www.mcgill.ca/internationalstudents/health/coverage/handbook

You may need to pay out of pocket and apply for reimbursement, but as I said, you would prefer a private clinic to a CLSC, as it is faster and less crowded.  Going back to the original point, this is why McGill doesn't need to provide a full service clinic to international students-- they can just walk to one of many private clinics downtown.  "
617,7uazjp,"Not sure if you get it but in CANADA aka many other provinces, international students are covered by provisional healthcare. As an international student who was accepted to UofT, UofA and UBC, I had to research their provisional healthcare systems. I have a severe cough rn, and the cheapest way to resolve this is to go to mcgill health services which is not great. Several of my friends have encountered situations where they had to pay lots of money out of pocket before putting down a claim. Again, the point is that other provinces do have better approaches to this. "
618,7uazjp,">Private clinics are covered at 100% with the blue cross insurance, and for that I do have a source: https://www.mcgill.ca/internationalstudents/health/coverage/handbook

Have you actually read the handbook? Blue Cross covers 100% but *only up to the RAMQ schedule of fees*. Private clinics can charge whatever they like which is usually, unsurprisingly, more than the RAMQ fee. Just in case you're in any doubt, here's what McGill say about, it, emphasis in the original:

>Please be aware that if you have **out-of-province or international student insurance, MOST** of these clinics will require you to **pay cash up-front** (you **may be partially reimbursed** by your province and/or insurance provider by submitting a claim afterwards).

For international students, the only clinic they can go to where they are guaranteed 100% insurance coverage is the McGill clinic. Out-of-province students can get treatment at *some* CLSCs, assuming they live in an area covered by a CLSC that accepts non-Quebec medicare cards, and in some cases this will involve extra fees an/or upfront payment. This is why McGill needs to be a healthcare provider."
619,8yyjo8,"I haven't used the mental health services, but for the clinic, wait times are ridiculous. Appointments open on the 15th of the month for the following month, and fill up in a few days. Drop-in fills up for the day pretty quickly, too: if you get there at 9, you might not see anyone til 3pm. And I've found the front desk people are not super friendly. The one triage nurse I saw, though (don't know if there are several) was really sweet."
620,8yyjo8,"1) McGill's mental health services are an utter joke, I'd look elsewhere for what you may need on that front.

2) If the Wellness Center is anything like the medical clinic on campus, then expect to wait for several hours. Wait times for any sort of health service on campus borders on ridiculous (when I got strep in February, I spent over half a day in the waiting room - not fun)."
621,8yyjo8,"I went, saw someone, cried, she told me she didn’t have a spot for me until September (in March), i eventually became depressed and failed two classes. I dont recommend. My experience with them is aight next to some of my friends stories. There’s lots of other private or public clinics you can go to"
622,8yyjo8,"Late comment but I'm not very pleased with the other comments here and I'm sure other people will have similar questions :p

If you're talking about urgent/emergency mental health issues, I don't have any experience with wait times for drop-ins. If you go to McGill Counselling Service and you're can't see someone soon enough, make use of helplines like suicide action montreal ( 1 866 277-3553 ).

On the other hand, if you're asking about less immediate support, I've been using the mental health services since early this year. I was lucky to get an initial appointment about 2 weeks after I showed up at the front desk, since I went right at the beginning of the semester. If you wait until around exam periods or later in the semester when it's really busy, you could be waiting for much longer. Afaik, right now or at the beginning of the semester would be a good time to try and book an appointment since they won't be as busy.

At your first appointment, you'll be asked to answer a questionnaire, then you'll meet with a counsellor. From there, they will determine what kind of support/plan you need that they can provide. Like any kind of therapy, it can be hit or miss since there are so many factors that can influence the sessions (your counsellor, your needs, how you communicate together, and whether they or the counselling service as a whole can provide what you need). It might work out great, or it might not work out at all.

That being said, if you do think you might need support, don't be intimidated by stories of how the service has failed people. McGill's resources are free, so it's worth a shot. Yes, the wait time can be long and it might not work out for you even if you do get followup. In that case, don't stop looking for support. If you think you need it, prioritize finding it."

636,7ewedl,"**Here ya go!!**

""Good evening,

I thought it appropriate to send an email to air my grievances about the troubling interview given by Deputy Provost Ollivier Dyens with regards to student mental health and well-being.

In his interview, the Deputy Provost clearly put the onus on students to live with ""good 'hygiene de vie',"" implying that mental illness is something than can be overcome by ""Eating well, sleeping well, being physically active, not cramming a week before the exam and spending the whole night cramming. Having good time-management skills. Not using any performance-enhancing drugs (like Ritalin), coffee and cigarettes."" (I quote verbatim). Aside from the fact that this is a way to make light of the fact that many neurodivergent students rely on medication like Ritalin to function on a daily basis and that addiction is not something that one can just get over, the statement has further troubling elements. 

Many students with mental health issues, including myself, feel as though we have been routinely failed or ignored by McGill when we voice our concerns or reach out for support, and Dyens is clearly failing to ""[ensure] the best student experience"" - it really seems to be quite the contrary. It is irresponsible and quite frankly patronizing at best to suggest that we do not know that good ""hygiene de vie"" is paramount to academic success, at worst it is actively harmful... Mental illness prevents students from achieving such habits and it certainly isn't as simple as just overcoming it.

This brings me to the point mentioned by the McGill Daily:

""During his term as DPSLL, Dyens has supervised portfolios vital to the well-being of students, particularly through Student Services, which includes Counselling and Psychiatric Services and the Office for Students with Disabilities. Between 2011 and 2016, McGill saw a 35 per cent increase in students seeking mental health services. However, over $2.5 million has been cut from Student Services’ overhead finances in the past seven years. The Stepped Care program was introduced in 2016 in response to these cuts, often pushing students in need of one-on-one therapy towards resources like online self-help literature, deemed “unlikely to be highly valuable on their own” by former McGill Mental Health Director Norman Hoffman. While Dyens claimed that Stepped Care eliminated wait list times for over 100 students, it did so by making one-on-one counselling less accessible. Students have reported being turned away from counselling for being “too high functioning” to warrant help. The most recent reforms to campus mental health services prevent students from seeing a psychiatrist unless the student has a referral from a general practitioner or a McGill counselor. Mental health care remains even less accessible for trans students, who continue to face barriers due to inadequate staff training, and for students experiencing eating disorders, whose services were recently scaled down.""

Students do not have the tools at their disposal to treat mental health issues at McGill due to these cuts, and putting the onus on students to pick up the slack when voicing our concerns is utterly outrageous.The rest of The Daily's article brings up many other valid criticisms of Dyens and I think it would be prudent to give it some consideration during his upcoming reappointment process. 

No amount of willpower can rewire your brain or produce the neurotransmitters you are missing or replace a one-on-one psychotherapy session. Dyens seems to fundamentally misunderstand what students who struggle with their mental health need and what mental illness entails, which is not a great start to say the least. I have worked with Jack.org, a national organization of young leaders changing the way we talk about mental health, and the societal stigma associated with mental health that we work so hard to dismantle is being further perpetuated by McGill as an institution through Dyens.

637,7ewedl,My issue is that this speaks to his wider understanding of mental health and mental illness. 
638,7ewedl,does he? or is that just a claim? 
639,7ewedl,"Seems like the main difference with UofT's schedule is that they have weekend exams. Not sure that removing breaks from high-stress periods would help.  
  
I can't blame him for dismissing the explanations. Every spring break of my undergrad was spent working on projects that profs assigned knowing we'd have extra time. Not much relaxing there.  
  
Mental health and mental illness are two different things, let's not confuse the two. The former is maintained by healthy habits, the latter as a medical problem. Access to psych services would not help the majority of students. The Ritalin comment seemed more about drug abuse than regular usage.  
  
Let's not pretend that students are particularly well-balanced, either. There's a reason why the library fills up near midterms and finals, and it's not because people have been keeping up with the work. That said, it's also not a reason to deny a fall break. Seems like the mob anger is justified if it's over reduced mental health services, but the fall break? Disproportionate reaction.  
  
Thanks for taking the time to explain the student POV, it's appreciated."

647,7f0aml,What are your thoughts on the recent [q&a](http://archive.is/sCq7J) with Ollivier Dyens in the McGill Reporter?
648,7f0aml,"Would the new office proposed in your Wellness initiative be working under Dep Prov SLL? If not, how would that office's duties overlap with those currently given to the DPSLL?"
649,7f0aml,"Back when I worked at the McGill Alumni Phonathon, I remember fundraising for specific mental health initiatives for the Faculty of Medicine.  One graduate gave a significant donation and told me a story as to why he is donating so much:

While this alum was doing an MDCM at McGill, his best friend struggled with mental health issues, culminating in him believing that he made an error that lead to the death of a patient.  The friend went on to commit suicide.  At the time there were no specific mental health services for MD students, so this alum donated a substantial amount to the current project to fund MD mental health services.

I have long felt that there is an uncomfortably high chance that the work-until-you-die culture on this campus could contribute to the suicide of a student.  With all of this context I have these questions:

1. Has the McGill Senate discussed the possibility that McGill Counseling Mental Health Service was changed for the worse in recent years?  

2. Do McGill Student Senators feel that appropriate priority is being placed by McGill on funding mental health services in the context of budget cuts from the Quebec government?  

3. To what extent is this issue unfixable by McGill without additional funding (perhaps RAMQ-funded counseling) from the Canadian and Quebec governments?
4. Has McGill considered enabling the Faculty of Medicine to hire counselors specialized in treating healthcare professionals and allowing students from Medicine, Nursing, Social Work, and PTOT to access these services?"
650,7f0aml,"Can you comment on what's going on at SSMU from your perspective, especially in light of the administration's visit to SSMU council to express their concern over lack of constitutional clarity/institutional wellness/etc? "
651,7f0aml,Drag him for filth!
652,7f0aml,"Our thoughts!:
Isabelle: Thank you for your question! The q&a brings up a lot of points in terms of more administrative barriers to implementing a fall break. The question on mitigating mental health challenges without a fall break has interesting suggestions, and these will be things that some students practice in order to be well. People have pointed out, and we agree, that the advice given isn’t a blanket solution to mental health issues on campus, and that students have different needs in terms of adequate support.

Jed: There needs to be recognition that dealing with mental health issues isn’t simply a matter of effort and it is concerning that the administrator in charge of overseeing student services would make a statement along those lines. McGill’s mental health strategy will never be effective if it stigmatizes and blames people struggling with mental health issues. 

Ahmer: I recognize that there are multiple administrative barriers in the implementation of a fall reading break, but students have repeatedly expressed their desire for this knowing the trade offs (based off 2015 survey). If the university is dedicated to the health of its students, those wishes should carry more weight. 
"
653,7f0aml,"Hey! Thank you for your question!
Isabelle: This office would be working under the Provost’s office (so under a bureaucratic position one step higher than the Deputy Provost), because the strategy is supposed to apply to the entire campus instead of just units that work with students. It’s supposed to support units on campus to develop their own unit-specific strategy so this means that student services and all the other units under SLL will have to develop their own strategy as to how they will foster overall wellness in their unit. There will be overlap in terms of developing multiple wellness strategies but less overlap in terms of scope! 
"
654,7f0aml,"1. 
Nahal: Mental Health Service was discussed at Senate on Thursday and the verbal report provided by Oliver Dyens & Martine Gauthier (Director of Student Services) showed positive changes so far. According to the statistics provided, there was a 50% increase in mental health services at McGill thus, accommodations had to be made. So far, McGill has added more psychiatrists, clinicians, and caseworkers and will be implementing a more formal triage system (kind of like ER at hospitals). Also, we have more professionals comparatively to other institutions. Finally, the report on Thursday also showed a decrease in average wait time from about 4 months to 4 weeks and future plan is to create a framework that allows students to have access to the services on the same day. From these stats, I think we are moving in a positive direction! 
Ahmer: This is a difficult issue, and there has been some disagreement on  best how to allocate resources and organize health services. Though there has been investment, and some positive indicators, we will have to see how effective this will be. 

2. Fatima: As Nahal mentioned above, there was information provided during yesterday’s senate to show that work is being done and money invested keeping mental health services in mind. Senate provides oversight on the budget and we can advocate for more money to be put towards mental health
Ahmer: Student Services is funded from student fees and is less impacted by budget cuts from the government. I would say that McGill is definitely prioritizing mental health to try and deal with the increased demand for services. There was a recent investment from the Rossy Foundation of approximately 1 million dollars that is being put towards health services and mental health. Though once again, the effectiveness of the exact approach can be debated.

3. 
Ahmer: Difficult to say. All campuses across North America are struggling to cope with increased demand for mental health services. There’s a limit to how many services the University itself can sustainably provide, and it’s unclear whether the problem simply requires more funding. Discussions are underway to provide better connections with services off campus to help deal with the burden. Additional government provided/funded services off campus would ease the burden, but is likely outside the scope of the University.  

4. 
Ahmer: The Faculty of Medicine currently does have the WELL Office (https://www.mcgill.ca/thewelloffice/well-office-homepage) which provides support and counseling for students working in health professions, catering specifically to their needs and schedules, in recognition of the challenges they face. 
Nahal: I am in my last year of nursing and before I became a senator, I am going to be honest, I definitely did not know about WELL Office. I only found this out recently, which means that majority of health care professional schools might not even know it exists. I think the main problem here is communication; students should be conveyed in the beginning of the year for example, about the resources that are available to to them.

655,7f0aml,thank you so much yall
656,5yofjb,"Hey Muna,

What would say the remit of SSMU should be? Where do you think it is over involved and where is it under involved? 

Also, last election 17.5% or so voted, 30% of that abstained 30% voted for opponent, so approx 9% of the student body endorsed the president. Now my point is with this painful lack of mandate what do you believe the role of SSMU is? As one of the many disillusioned with SSMU all I want is SSMU to do STFU, not push radical policies that hurt the funding pools. Now ramble over, do you believe your platform represents this 91% of the McGill population? If not please elaborate.

Thanks for doing this! There's been a lot of talk about the lack of accountability of SSMU's governance structures. As President, what would you do to ensure that SSMU's various bodies are held accountable and don't infringe on one another's jurisdiction?"
659,5yofjb,"hey, thanks for doing this

wait time for a first appointment as well as that for a regular appointment at the mental health services is now between 3 and 4 weeks. i've heard similar complaints about the office for students with disabilities. i think it's fair to say that the needs of many students simply are not being met at all. i myself have to now spend money in order to receive private practice. how specifically do you intend on improving mental health services? furthermore, considering that it seems that nearly all candidates discuss a desire for the improvement of mental health services, how does this plan differ from that of your opponents?"

663,5yofjb,"Regarding your commitment to create a Sexual Violence Policy for SSMU employees:

I know that these policies are extremely complex in nature (given the work of the original Sexual Assault Policy Working Group), but do you have any general pointers on how this hypothetical SSMU policy would differ from the campus-wide Sexual Violence Policy (however weak it ended up being)? Would it define a system for disclosure separate from the University's, or would it use the S.V.P.'s flow and simply add in institutionalized penalties and predefined courses of action when situations like D. Aird's arise?"
664,5yofjb,"Muna,

At last week's council meeting, the SSMU executive publicly stated that the former President of SSMU had resigned in response to allegations of sexual and gendered violence.  They also stated that the executive had just been informed of the allegation.

Was the SSMU executive right to disclose this uncorroborated allegation of sexual violence to the public before any investigation had been undertaken?  Would you publicly disclose such an allegation against a fellow executive as SSMU President?  What would you do if a fellow executive wanted to publicly disclose such an allegation against another executive?"
665,5yofjb,"Hi Muna!

Thank you so much for doing this.

A couple of questions from me:
What do you think are some current shortfalls or inadequacy of SSMU in serving its student population? What are your goals to address these faults and ensure that SSMU is moving forward?"
666,5yofjb,"Hey Muna. People always tell me to vote in student elections, but nobody ever explains to me why any of this matters at all.

Could you give me your best example of something SSMU accomplished or changed, that McGill's administration/faculty did not endorse? I do not understand the point of SSMU unless they can accomplish significant goals that are contrary to the interests of other groups. If they never do, SSMU is totally powerless. No?

670,5yofjb,"Hi Muna,

Thank you for doing this AMA! My questions are regarding your platform points of democratic and financial accountability. What do you aim to do as SSMU President to:
1) Address the discrepancy that exists within the reporting of financial transactions for services and ISGs, while making financial documentation more detailed to increase transparency. 
2) According to [the 2016-2017 Budget](http://ssmu.mcgill.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Global-Budget-2016-2017.pdf):

""Administrative expenses are, by far, the largest section of the Operating Budget. This category includes items
such as salaries for the permanent staff that assist with the administration of the Society (e.g. accountants, IT
support staff), student staff salaries, bank charges, legal fees, auditor fees, insurance fees, and office supplies
costs. These types of costs are reflected in General Administration (Dept. 3021). This section also includes IT
(Dept. 2000), and Executive Administrative Departments, which primarily include telephone costs, printing
costs, and student staff salaries.
The Society’s total administrative expenses are around $1.5M per year. This can be roughly divided into
permanent staff salaries (72.6%); student staff salaries (9.1%); IT costs (2.3%); professional, legal, and
insurance fees (9.5%); and printing, office supplies, postage, telephones, photocopying, automobile, and
bank fees expenses (6.5%).
From 2015-2016, the total net administration expenses have increased by approximately $130K. However, a
large part of this increase (approx. $80K) was due to salaries shifting from non-administrative departments
into General Administration due to operational restructuring. Thus, the “real” increase in expenses to the
Society coming from the administration departments is closer to $50K. It is also worth noting that around
30%-50% of this $50K increase can be attributed to inflation.""

How do you plan on working with the VP Finance to stop the obscure tradition of reporting General Administration as a $1.3M budget line item without reporting on specific salaries, legal and consulting fees, and etc?

Thank you in advance for your answers."
671,5yofjb,"Hey! Thanks for your question. I recognize that trust in SSMU is at an all-time low, and I completely agree that there needs to be systemic change to make SSMU more about students. I believe the role of SSMU, primarily, is to provide services to students effectively. Currently, many SSMU services are underfunded and underdeveloped, as mismanagement of funds diverts necessary resources from the key services that need it most. To that end, one of the cornerstones of my platform is revitalizing mental health services by using the services of qualified McGill graduate and medical students, creating a budget allocation for mental health services, and focusing the President’s research budget on mental health capacity. I will also focus generally, as my number one priority, on increasing the range of student services offered. 

In terms of the second part of your question, I believe I can effectively represent all McGill students. I think my platform focuses on key principles that matter to all students, like mental health, making SSMU accountable to the average student, and ensuring a separation of powers within SSMU that provides more channels for students to have their voices heard. Returning the focus of SSMU to serving students is something I think the vast majority of McGill students believe should happen. 
"
672,5yofjb,"Hey, thank you for such a pertinent question – especially pressing at this time. If a student disclosed to me that one of the SSMU executive committee members had sexually assaulted a student, I would immediately take action: I think in light of recent events, it is unfortunately clear that the current SSMU executive is characterized by passivity and inaction. If an allegation is brought to my attention, I would immediately report the incident to SSMU’s Human Resources staff, help the student file a complaint with the SSMU Equity Committee if they wanted, as well as a complaint with McGill (given the power dynamic between executives and constituents, situations such as these are very much in a McGill context). While the investigation is underway, the executive in question will be suspended from their role. Following the outcome of the investigation, the executive in question will either be reinstated or asked to resign. 

If the student who came forward is the victim, the most important thing to do is to make sure that their needs are met. First, I would take the necessary steps to ensure the anonymity of the victim. Second, I would utilize the necessary resources to ensure that the student accesses the necessary support resources (such as SACOMSS, CIRCLES, a community response and resource, Peer Support Centre, The Montréal Sexual Assault Centre, and Office for Sexual Violence, Response, Support, and Education). Finally, I would make sure that the person in question’s claim is addressed professionally, speedily, and adequately. 

I hope this answers your question!
"
673,5yofjb,this is a really good question
674,5yofjb,"
Hey! Thanks so much for your question! 
If elected, as President, I would increase accountability on three fronts: 
(1) Democratic Accountability: currently, minutes for the Board of Directors meetings are not available online. Board of Directors meetings are often secretive and many discussions are had in confidential session. If we, as students, cannot access those minutes and see how our executives are acting: how are we supposed to hold them accountable? So I will mandate that minutes from any SSMU governance body be posted on the SSMU website within 48 hours. Additionally, I will make all Executives send a report to the VP Internal each week, to be included in the weekly communication from the SSMU to the membership as a means of increasing engagement.
 (2) Financial Accountability: (a) I will work with the VP Finance to hire students for about three to four hours a week for the purpose of itemizing all SSMU transactions and expenditures, and posting them on the SSMU website. Currently, over a million dollars falls into the “General Operating Budget” with no other explanations given. I will change this. ; 
(b) I will also create an ad hoc financial management committee to better hold SSMU accountable. 
This will increase transparency and help members hold the Executive to account in terms of where their fees are going. 
Hope it answers your question!

"
676,5yofjb,"Hey, thanks so much for your question! I have experienced the inefficiencies of the Mental Health services at McGill first hand and this is one of the reasons why I decided to make it one of the cornerstones of my platform. I think it is a struggle for a lot of students and should be the number one priority not only for SSMU but for the McGill administration as well. As such, I will not only push for the improvement of mental health services within SSMU but advocate for the increase in the infrastructure of Mental Health and Counseling at the Board of Governors. 

Currently, SSMU dedicates $0 to the provision of mental health services. A $0.40 opt-outable fee per student exists but this is obviously not enough. I think more money needs to go into researching best practices as well as increasing the funding of student services such as the Peer Support Centre and the Nightline.   

I also would like to utilize the services of graduate students and medical students in order to be able to quickly do initial assessments in order to assign urgent cases to counselors promptly. A lot of people get turned away from the mental health services, no matter how urgent their situation is. An improved triage area would ensure that no urgent cases have been missed. Additionally, I think it is really important to streamline the relationship between mental health services and the Peer Support Centre (Mental Health services often do not refer to the Peer Support Centre like they are supposed to).  

Thanks again for your question! 
"
677,5yofjb,"Hi, great question! This question has been asked since time immemorial, and is as important today as ever. As SSMU President, I sit on the Board of Governors, and thus have a direct line to the McGill Administration. I would definitely explore what could be done to open the doors, as shaving ten seconds off the trudge to McLennan can definitely add up- 15 seconds times 80 lecture + exam days is 20 minutes, and who couldn’t use an extra 20 minutes to cram for finals! However, judging by previous attempts at this seemingly impossible feat, we will likely need a SSMU d’état to get the doors working again!"
678,5yofjb,"Good question, this is my single-issue vote if someone addresses this"
679,5yofjb,"Thanks for your excellent question! I believe that SSMU’s purpose is to provide vital student services, such as mental health, clubs, and SACOMMS, and focus on making the student experience at McGill better. For the second part of your question, quite frankly, after seeing how its been run for the past few years, like many students I too have questioned SSMU’s validity. That’s why I’m running. I believe I can create systemic change in SSMU to make it an organization that is not a detriment to the McGill community, but rather an asset, by focussing on student services."
680,5yofjb,"Hi,
Thank you for your question! I believe that SSMU should focus its energy on providing student services. SSMU has definitely become over-political in recent years and necessary resources have not been concentrated on student services. For example, a significant amount of money was spent by SSMU on legal advise related to the Igor Sadikov situation. This advise was then ignored by the Board of Directors, costing student money that could’ve been spent on vital student services, such as mental health, which is a cornerstone of my platform. It is important to return SSMU’s main focus to providing the services students need."
681,5yofjb,"There are some good things in your answer, notably referring the complainant to SSMU's Human Resources staff and McGill.

But several suggestions you make are deeply concerning.

There are several problems with involving the Equity Committee.  First, it is not within the mandate of the Equity Committee to address complaints of sexual assault.  The mandate of the Equity Committee is to address ""harassment or discrimination"" against ""groups that have been historically and culturally disadvantaged.""

Second, the Equity complaint process involves an investigator making a recommendation for disciplinary action to SSMU Council.  There is a serious problems with using this process for an allegation of sexual assault. A political body will be making decisions in cases of alleged sexual assault on the part of political officers.  Such a situation creates the potential for bias in the decision-making process.

Finally, let's not forget that the Equity Committee complaints process has been widely criticized by students in the past [http://www.mcgilltribune.com/news/equity-policy-could-face-revision-following-farnan-gate-backlash/ http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/mcgill-faces-massive-backlash-after-ridiculous-apology-for-microaggression-over-emailed-joke-obama-clip].

In addition, you state, ""[w]hile the investigation is underway, the executive in question will be suspended from their role.""  Do you really think that an executive should be suspended from office on the basis of a single, unsubstantiated allegation prior to any investigation?  Should the executive be given a chance to respond prior to a decision being made about suspension?  Should an assessment be made about whether there is prima facie evidence to support the claim prior to the suspension?  Recall that these investigations may last for weeks or months, so a suspension could severely affect the functionality of SSMU.

Finally, you state, ""I would take the necessary steps to ensure the anonymity of the victim.""  Do you mean that you support bringing disciplinary actions on the basis of anonymous accusations of sexual assault, where the accuser does not even identify himself/herself?  Do you favor suspending or removing executives on the basis of anonymous statements?"
682,5yofjb,Thanks for your answer!
683,5yofjb,"With respect, Muna, your answer to this question demonstrates significant ignorance.

First, there is no need to explore what could be done to reopen the door since it is already known.  The doors are closed because it would cost McGill $210,000 per year to post a full-time security agent during opening hours and the libraries cannot afford it [http://www.mcgill.ca/library/node/8423].  SSMU could reopen the doors by using its Library Improvement Fund to pay this cost but has chosen to spend the money on other projects it considers more important.

Second, the Board of Governors is only involved in high-level governance, not in the administration of things like which doors are open.  Moreover, there is only a single member of the McGill Administration on the Board, so sitting on the Board is not a direct line to the administration.  SSMU's direct line comes from the administration's recognition of SSMU as the official body representing students and their willingness (especially the DPSLL's) to meet regularly with SSMU leaders to discuss issues of common concern.  Almost literally nothing SSMU has ever successfully advocated to change at McGill has happened through the Board of Governors."
684,5yofjb,"I agree SSMU should be more focused on student services. It disappoints me when I see a lot of SSMU's efforts going to establishing impotent stances on various geopolitical issues, whether I agree with the stance or not. Any motion with ""commitment"" or ""solidarity"" makes me cringe. For example, despite agreeing with the principle behind the recent ""Ratification of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals"" I voted against it. I see this (solitary) question in the Winter GA as SSMU playing Model UN and patting themselves on the back with student money.

Do you see this as a problem and will you do anything to encourage motions with more substance and direct relevance to McGill students?"
685,5yofjb,"I wish more folks would see this. So many people are disengaged from SSMU that too often, a politicized, extreme, but small group of students gets a magnified power within the organization. It's time to make SSMU student focused."
686,5yofjb,"LOL that's not how anonymity works. If a complaint is brought forward, the identity of the survivor is known to the President, but ensuring the anonymity of the survivor in the public eye is widely recognized as best practice and an important measure to ensure they are not on the receiving end of any backlash. Obviously any accusation needs to be taken seriously, allowing executives who have evidence of sexual assault against them to stay in power allows them to continue to use their power to perpetuate violence. "
687,5yofjb,"> The doors are closed because it would cost McGill $210,000 per year to post a full-time security agent during opening hours and the libraries cannot afford it

Despite the fact that the question and answer are both jokes...

There are many doors at McGill that do not have security guards. Why does this entrance to this library need a security guard? Whenever the Redpath doors come up on this sub the response is always about the cost of a security guard, but nobody is ever able to explain why a guard is necessary in the first place."
688,5yofjb,"You're conflating anonymity with confidentiality.

I'd like to know whether Muna believes that the identity of the complainant should be made known to the accused as part of the process or whether the complainant should remain anonymous.

As for suspension, the question is whether a single uncorroborated claim should lead to immediate suspension."
689,5yofjb,"Hey, 

Thank you for your remarks. I will handle each case on a case by case basis and respect the wishes of the survivors. "
690,5yofjb,"Thank you for taking the time to respond.

To be clear, your position is that an executive accused of sexual assault should not be told during the investigation who is making the accusation if that is what the survivor wishes, correct?

The right to a fair hearing includes the right to know the case put against the accused and the right to answer that case.  How could a hearing be fair if the accused doesn't even know who is claiming to be the victim?"

694,4aekss,"Hi Ben,

Thanks for doing this AMA. I have a few questions for you:

1. Would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses, or 1 horse-sized duck?*

2. Should SSMU maintain its support for Demilitarize McGill in light of their ""call to action"" to vandalize university structures and monuments as an act of protest?

4. The recent BDS motion generated significant controversy at McGill. There was hateful rhetoric and misrepresentation of both sides, as I am sure you are aware. McGill Principal Suzanne Fortier even sent out an email condemning the BDS movement. One of the concerns addressed by both her email and the No campaign was the proposal to sever ties with Israeli universities. Do you feel that severing ties with any university (not just those condemned by the BDS movement) can be an effective solution? To what extent do you think any such severance should be executed, if at all? What would happen (in your hypothetical scenario) to any McGill researchers still collaborating with researchers in those universities? Can we stand to improve the situation by making use of our ties with such universities to work with them in promoting peaceful solutions of mutual academic benefit?

2. Who's your favorite pornstar?

5. One of the concerns raised in the decision to hire a 7th executive is that the workload was too much for 6 people to bear. However, you have proposed a reduction in the amount of signatures required for student-run referenda with the goal of increasing ""grassroots change"". Do you feel that this decrease in signatures could negate the benefits of having a 7th executive? Could students become *too* involved, to the point that the executive gets overwhelmed with potentially banal motions?

6. I see your proposed deficits in the budget as a sort of ""punishment"" towards students who voted no to the fee increase, as you state that it will ""eats [sic] a small amount into many different funds the SSMU has (the library fund, etc.)"". Punishment can be used to reinforce behavioral changes, but why do you feel that this is the best option? Is SSMU going into austerity mode in the the coming year? (how ironic)

7. What do you consider your greatest successes and greatest failures during your time at McGill?

8. A lot of students in the life science majors have a certain mentality - get good grades, get into med school (or a Masters program), do undergraduate research, and not get involved in frivolous SSMU politics. How will you reach out to these students? What ""grassroots change"" can your presidency accomplish that will inform such students of the importance of SSMU?

7. What do you plan to do after your degree?

*Traditional reddit AMA question

**Traditional /r/mcgill AMA question"
695,4aekss,"Dear Ben,

Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA. My question is mainly about your desire to reform SSMU and builds off Jermark's question on facebook.

You talk about past grassroots led change you have lead, could you give more examples when you have fulfilled or substantive divisive issues?

Lastly, you write ""not as an insider SSMU executive, councilor, or senator"" but your language (framing things in safe space vocab) and divisive opinions on the BDS motion all of which affect your ability to form a broad grassroots movement. 


Much of what people deride in SSMU  ARE things like BDS and safe space monotone. 


So I guess to wrap this all up in one question, you talk about your ability to form grassroot and wide coalitions, but when have you reached out past SSMU and had to grapple with those viewpoints? It seems you live within the SSMU house more than out.
 
and thanks for taking the time out your day to answer this! 


oh as Jordan answered a similar question I just thought I'd post it here if you wanted to respond. Dont feel obligated to: 

""""The bonds of trust have been broken. SSMU-tocrats have a tendency of pledging campaigns in the interest of the entire student body, then continuously valuing self-interest over collective interest. I’ve been willing to take personal criticism to advocate for students typically neglected by SSMU.""""

696,4aekss,"Ben,

From the conversation surrounding your campaign, as well as your article ""Alone in Crowded Rooms: A personal struggle with depression"", it is apparent that mental health is a main priority of yours, which is a welcome change in the conversation surrounding student politics. However, I personally had some concerns regarding the timing of your article as well as some of the language within the article itself. Seeing as the release of your article ""Alone in Crowded Rooms: A personal struggle with depression"" coincided with your announcement to run for president by several weeks, it seems a bit opportunistic; almost as if it was seen as a chance to get your name in the public arena. What I find particularly concerning about this possibility is: in claiming to empathize with those marginalized by their mental illness, as you yourself suffer from depression, you really are using the suffering of others as political leverage for your own gain. Additionally, what further concerns me is that the narrative throughout that particular article portrays yourself as somewhat of a ""hurting-hero"" - a casting that, as someone who has struggled with suicidal tendencies for the majority of their adult life, I find personally insulting. However, in all fairness to you, I have no doubt that these things truly are a coincidence and that any off-putting rhetoric was unintentional. My question to you is, in what areas do you think mental health support on campus could be improved, and in what areas does the current system lack the capacity to properly process those in need? "
697,4aekss,"Hey Ben, what is our plan if Trashy Spice gets elected?"
698,4aekss,"Ben, during the press debates you waffled a bit on whether or not you support the SSMU Constitutional ""Ammendment"" 13.2 + 13.3 which would restrict what motions can be adopted on the grounds that they are ""external and divisive.""

I am not at all a supporter of Jordan's campaign, but I cannot vote for you in good faith until I have a solid answer: As president, what would you do if this motion is passed? Do you agree that SSMU council and GA's need to be focused entirely on issues that are internal to McGill that are not ""divisive?""

704,4aekss,Hahahaha we're working on stopping that - sorry!
705,4aekss,"Hey CatanOverlord! I just want to quickly say that your reputation proceeds you haha, I've heard all about some of these questions. Let me try to address then!

1.Without a doubt 100 duck sized horses. Have you ever tried to fight a horse? That would be a terrible idea. A horse sized duck would just be that but WAY worse.

2. Demilitarize McGill largely falls under the external portfolio so deciding on how we will proceed in light of that knowledge will be something for the external, in consultation with the rest of the executive team, to discuss. I encourage you to ask the question to you're current external candidate though! Here's a link to David's event page:
https://www.facebook.com/events/1061772407198129/

3. So first of all, before answering you question, I'd like to clarify that as a presidential candidate who is suppose to be representative of the student body and it's mandates, I recognize that the BDS has currently been shut down during online ratification, and thus will not be acting on its behalf as an executive.

In regards to cutting ties with universities, the BDS Action Network, as well as the motion they brought forward, never explicitly said they wanted to cut ties with Israeli universities. I recognize that issue is far more complex than any answer I can give you here, but I absolutely understand the real concerns students have brought forward surrounding rhetoric used on both sides of the BDS campaign. With these sorts of hyper-complex issues I would much rather leave the decision to the student body to decide the mandate of the president, no matter what is passed I will act as an representative of the student body.

4. ______ _____ LETS PLAY HANGMAN

5. I'm not sure I understand the question. Student-run referenda let students bring forward a motion to be voted on by the student body, so if you're asking about a hypothetical situation where students just start mandating the executives to do tons of things, those motions would still have to be passed by the rest of campus. Whatever is then passed is the job of the SSMU to do, but there are many more people than just executives to delegate to; in fact many of those student-run referenda mandate councillors, or senators to do something rather than executives.

TD;DR No, I am not concerned with this and look forward to the student initiatives that are brought forward! :)

6. Just to clarify this is not a punishment at all, and that was only one of the budgets that I was giving as an option. The deficit budget would allow the student union more time to work on the issue, and it would in no way have direct impacts on the student body. In any case, all the budgets (break-even with cuts to services/staff/etc, and the two deficit budgets) I plan on publishing in the papers for student feedback before anything is passed. Haha I promise there is no internal austerity currently planned!

7. I think my greatest success since coming to McGill actually doesn't really have anything to do with the SSMU. As a student, last summer I lost a lot of people close to me in a very short period of time and found myself depressed, but after months of working my way out I finally did. In a final effort to close that chapter on my life entirely I wrote an article, trying to own a part of my life that was largely debilitating and turn it into a resource for others. If you want to check it out I attach put the link here!

http://www.mcgilltribune.com/alone-crowded-room-personal-struggle-depression/

My greatest failure since coming here has definitely been the lack of time I've been able to give my direct and extended family. As someone who grew up with a lot of support from the community around me I value family more than most things, and have the strong believe that family is much more than who shares your blood. I have done what I can to give my parents, brother, and nephews the time they deserve but it's been tough. Not only that but I leave behind a self-defined little brother (Sam), and sister (Mallory) that I think about every day and wish I could be with more often. If they are reading this somehow, love you both!!!!!

8. It's no secret our student body is very disenchanted with the way SSMU works right now. A floor fellow recently posted on my wall as well talking about how first year students, only a couple months in, have already started to develop negative opinions on the SSMU, so it's not surprising to me to hear that Life Science students may find themselves not wanting to get involved.

This problem is a very layered one, that can start to be helped with the first year outreach program (FYOP) that I purpose in my platform, that helps encourage students to get involved from the beginning of our careers. But there is so much more we can do.

I would like to quickly clarify that I think the SSMU executives this year did and amazing job, and were probably one of the most competent exec groups we've seen in a long time, but they were understaffed and less-than-present on our campus. Making sure, as an executive, that myself, as well as the rest of the office, are doing everything we can to come out to student/student group-run events (such as Life Science events) to engage with the student body and let them know how to work with SSMU to improve their experience I think will make a massive difference. I plan on being a very visible and supportive president during my term.

Not only this but looking into more ways in which we can keep the student body engaged and involved in the SSMU through media outlets will be important. A (very rough) idea that I've brought up was looking into using some of the tv's located all over campus, that currently just show the McGill logo all day every day, to display what is happening in SSMU instead. These TV's could show how you can get involved, recent achievements by students, and more.

9. TBH I don't really know yet! I wrote my LSAT last summer incase that's something that I want to pursue, but I've been pretty involved since my 12th year of high school and am kind of excited to take some time of. Who know, maybe I'll even travel a little :)"
706,4aekss,"> I see your proposed deficits in the budget as a sort of ""punishment"" towards students who voted no to the fee increase, as you state that it will ""eats [sic] a small amount into many different funds the SSMU has (the library fund, etc.)"". Punishment can be used to reinforce behavioral changes, but why do you feel that this is the best option? Is SSMU going into austerity mode in the the coming year? (how ironic)

I'd just like to clarify something: the SSMU is not able to use restricted fees for anything other than the purpose for which they were intended. In other words, we would not be able to take money out of the Library Improvement Fund, or any other fund, to cover operating deficits. 

I will reiterate what I've said repeatedly at Council, which is that I plan to present a break even budget for 2016-2017 in April, which will result in significant cuts to many areas of the budget. The only way I would consider presenting a deficit budget for 2016-2017 would be if it was accompanied by a (realistic) plan to balance the budget in a relatively short period of time (i.e., quickly enough that we would not dip into our capital reserves to a degree that would be detrimental to the financial sustainability of the Society).

707,4aekss,"> You talk about past grassroots led change you have lead, could you give more examples when you have fulfilled or substantive divisive issues?
> Lastly, you write ""not as an insider SSMU executive, councilor, or senator"" but your language (framing things in safe space vocab) and divisive opinions on the BDS motion all of which affect your ability to form a broad grassroots movement.

Hey, thanks for the question!

In regards to you're inquiry as to what grassroots change I've done in the past, the two largest things I'm proud of would be petitioning the SSMU to create a new student position on SSMU council for Environment students, and to lower the amount of signatures required for a student to bring forward a referendum from 500 to 100.

As a student who has gone through the process of getting signatures, I can personally attest to it being a massive hindrance in student led change. As well, being a student - not a council, senator, or executive - leading this sort of grassroots change sends a clear message to the executive body that the students want more streams in which they can take control over the mandates of those representing them.

I've taken other executive roles on grassroots campaigns, such as the Environment Students' Society's initiative to build a new study space on campus and developing a coffee co-op program (both soon to be up and running in the next few weeks!), but I'll spare you the details of non-SSMU related activism unless you'd like to hear more haha.

It is very true that I have spent a fair amount of time on presidential committees, sitting at SSMU council, or at senate, but what's important to recognize is that I've done this as a student. I am not someone who has been wrapped up in these committees as part of my role on council, rather, as a student who wants to remind the executives of a student's perspective. The execs can (understandably) forget this perspective since they are CONSTANTLY at work in the office. I have done intensive research into what this role entails, so that, if elected, I can serve as a president that listens to, and serves the constituents of the society rather than one that perpetuates the unfortunate (but once again understandable) lack of faith that has been growing in the student body for the SSMU.

I hope that answered your question but feel free to follow up and I can hopefully elaborate more on anything I missed! :)

Lastly, I was just wondering if could you clarify what you mean by ""when you have fulfilled or substantive divisive issues?""

Thanks again!"
708,4aekss,What are your thoughts on BDS Ben? 
709,4aekss,"Hey DonnyBurger22, part of me is glad you asked this and part of me is (i hope understandably) upset by it. However, I am not surprised, and when I say I am upset by it, it's simply because this - the idea that my personal struggle with depression could be interpreted as a campaign tactic - was a massive concern of mine from the start. During the printing process I specifically requested numerous times (and you can check with the Tribune about this if you'd like) to have the article published considerably before election period so that this wouldn't happen. However, the editorial calendar was rigid and the only spot available for publishing was the time that it inevitably came out at. Though I did think there would be enough space in-between publishing the article and announcing my candidacy to ensure they were not connected, I am not naive to the fact that some may still interpret it this way, so I am thankfully to you for giving me a platform to elaborate (and to your faith in my honesty).

Additionally, thank you for your question about the areas in which mental health support is lacking, let me try to address that. The core of the problem, as I see it now, is that many of the (in most cases great) efforts to improve campus mental health have *not* been focussed on preventative measures. In the last few years students have been cornered into providing funding to mental health spaces, services, and more. Though all of these initiatives are amazing, the lack of responsibility being taken by the admin to make it so students shouldn't have to come to these services in the first place has left much of the burden on the victims & students themselves.

My platform highlights some specific ways in which we can start to address these sorts of preventative solutions. One of them is lobbying for a Mandatory Mental Health 101 Training for faculty through senate. As well, other initiatives are highlighted that seek to support the clinic on the other end, by providing more space for it to run its group therapy session in the SSMU building.

I hope this answered your question! :)"
710,4aekss,"As someone who has spent my entire life battling with mental illnesses, I couldn't welcome this comment enough. You are so right. I know many people with mental illnesses who are feeling the same way as you. I am familiar with Ben and can guarantee everything he says is a well-thought out political move. But never did I think he would stoop as low as to use mental illness to further his SMMU career."
711,4aekss,"I would agree that while I strongly strongly sympathize with Ben's situation in losing loved ones, it seems a period of intense sadness is a completely human way of reacting to such loss.  However, to say this is a mental illness is, to me, trivializing the people who suffer from chemical imbalances causing them to be affected in a life long manner. If ben was so worried about timing and the impression it would have given off, he could have easily published it after the elections. "
712,4aekss,"Hahahahahhahahaha lets be real Jordan, it's not about IF Trashy Spice gets elected, it's about when. I think both of us will probably end up competing again, but this time for one of the coordinators spots being opened up on Trashy's committee to provide ""large, breakable object balanced precariously on the edge.""

I look forward to the debate!!!"
713,4aekss,"Hey! I'm really glad you asked this, a few friend mentioned to me they didn't think my answer was clear enough either so let me try to clarify here.

I do not support this motion. I am a strong believer in direct democracy - a space where we students can mandate our government to do exactly what we want it to - and believe the GA is an incredible way for students to enact it. I believe this motion is a hinderance to that ability.

In regards to the external an divisive motions that my opponent's campaign sites as being things the SSMU shouldn't have a position on, such as the Climate Change Policy, I think the idea that climate change doesn't directly effect students on our campus is incredibly misleading. Climate change and pollution disproportionately effect lower income and marginalized groups/students on campus. By having a steering committee label policy's like this as ""external"", one is essentially stopping debate on the issue, and saying they value (some) engineering students over marginalized and lower income students that may be affected by this, such as some indigenous students, and others.

Not only this but I think the motion, as it stands, is under-worked. There is no mandate for who would sit on this GA steering committee, and it brushes over the fact that it makes it impossible for motions and amendments to come from the floor, since they would have to go through the steering committee first.

Hope that clarifies my position a little bit better! :)"

726,4aekss,*MOSSSSSSSSSSE
727,4aekss,"A certain amount doesn't need to be spent each year, however because those funds are restricted, it still would not help cover operating losses, so I don't see why you would bother holding the money within that fund. For example, we could run a $100,000 surplus in the LIF next year, and a $100,000 deficit in the Operating Fund, but these amounts would be shown separately on our financial statements and should be considered separately.

The reason that they're shown separately is that, because the LIF is restricted, running a $100K profit during 2016-2017 just means that we will have to run a $100K loss during another year at some point in the future (to offset the accumulation of funds in the LIF).

With the Operating Fund, on the other hand, a $100K loss would be made up by withdrawing $100K from the Capital Expenditures Reserve Fund (CERF), which has significant long-term impact on the SSMU's finances due to the future interest foregone by reducing the capital in the CERF. 

Note that when we generally talk about ""the SSMU budget"" or about SSMU running a surplus or deficit, we're talking about the budget for the Operating Fund. The restricted funds (e.g. Health and Dental, Library Improvement, Awards of Distinction) exist separately and have separate columns, revenues, and expenses on our financial statements. . 

Does all that make sense? 

edit: spelling"
728,4aekss,"Yes it does! Thank you, Zach!"
729,4xn8ez,"Just a tip for when you go to Mental Health (the only place at McGill that will prescribe you antidepressants for the first time): you should not ask for antidepressants directly.  Mention you are open to medication and to talk therapy, or otherwise it might look like you are seeking drugs, and they will be less likely to consider that option."
730,4xn8ez,[deleted]
731,4xn8ez,"I would recommend going to the counciling service first and getting a referral from them, it really speeds up the process. If you're taking antidepressants for anxiety or depression it's best to do some kind of  councilling or therapy at the same time. Therapy appointments at mental health have month long waiting lists, while if you have a dossier at councilling they can usually get you an appointment within 2 weeks! Hope this is helpful! 
"
732,4xn8ez,"""drug seeking"" refers to people who try to get drugs to 1) get high or 2) sell them on the black market. ADs are non-addictive, dont get you high, and arent worth much on the street, so asking for them is nothing like asking for benzos/painkillers/stimulants."
733,4xn8ez,"Guess that makes sense, however I was looking mostly at SSRIs and beta blockers rather than, say, benzos, so I doubt they'll worry much that I'm trying to get high or something. But yeah, I guess ""gimme drugz plz"" isn't the best approach :P"
734,4xn8ez,"Alright, thanks! "
735,4xn8ez,"That's actually very helpful, thanks!"
736,4xn8ez,"Yes, however saying straight up ""I want drugs"" is not going to help you out."
737,4xn8ez,"To say that ADs are non-addictive right off the bat is not correct.  There are many different drugs you can take for depression, some of them are very dependence building and hard to get off.

All I am saying is that starting a new AD is nothing to take lightly, and Mental Health will probably want to prescribe you ADs less if it seems like you want to skip all the possible other options like talk therapy."
738,4xn8ez,"Even SSRIs are drugs people have immense trouble quitting.  I don't mean to discourage you from drugs, I just do really encourage you to see what other options exist before starting an antidepressant.  McGill Mental Health will certainly give you the drugs you need if you need them, but they will also want to try talk therapy first, especially if this is your first experience with seeing a psychiatrist/psychologist.  "
739,4xn8ez,"its really not a death sentence to getting help either. Its a really common thoughts/reaction people have in a time of crisis, thinking that meds are the fastest and most effective treatment. For something like depression, im sure the doctors/nurses will understand. Again, saying ""i want drugs for pain/sleep/adhd"" is MUCH different than ""i want drugs for depression""."
740,4xn8ez,"True, but they're not drugs that I could potentially get high on, which I feel is their biggest worry. Honestly though I just don't feel like talk therapy is for me, since I've never been one to just ""talk it out"", but even from a more technical standpoint therapy sessions would require me to have regular appointments that I'm not even sure are covered by OHIP, and that's not something I could afford out of pocket."
741,4xn8ez,"You have a certain amount of sessions covered by McGill's Mental Health fund.  Don't let money stop you from going, you certainly have some fund or insurance covering some sessions for free."
742,4xn8ez,"Huh, that's interesting. Well I'll  make sure to ask about that then. Thanks :3"

747,5cob77,"The outcome of the survey will better help to understand what the student body needs, then go to the faculty.

 The mental health notes are an example because recently, same day appointments were quietly discontinued. So if you are not okay before a final, now you can't go directly from your final (before opening the booklet of course) to mental health services, instead you may have to wait two weeks to get a note for your prof. I'm sure there's a general idea of what our needs are, but I don't think any conclusions have been made before the final data has been analysed.

he also shows examples that are VERY similar to the assignments during his lectures, which actually helps a ton! (you can also find previous lecture notes here: http://www.math.mcgill.ca/xlu/teaching.html)

i think asking questions on the 263 facebook group helps a lot as well. a bunch of people (even prof. lu) regularly answer questions there and when you don't grasp a concept, it's probably best to ask there or look at what others have already asked.

754,3tvnoh,"Don't worry, it's got nothing to do with you. The ECSE program at McGill is not exactly their selling point. If you still can, I'd suggest you switch into science. Otherwise, here's some general advice.

Don't let academics define you as a person. You're not a failure because of your grades or what not. You've got accepted to UCL with full scholarship. That says to me that you've got the potential to go far no matter the path you take in life.

If you want to do better in school, get a tutor. If you're paying this much for tuition, a few hundreds more or less shouldn't make a difference. This will help you avoid having to teach yourself everything for classes where the lectures are not the best. 

When dealing with a problem, first see if you have any control over it and if so, how. Come up with a list of what you can do to make a difference. Then just do your best. If things don't go your way, don't fret it and just move on. You get a lot of opportunities to roll the dice in life. Some times you win, some times you don't.

As for the loneliness issue, make some time for a club or for volunteering somewhere. It will make you feel better. For example, there are lots of retirement homes where the seniors would gladly welcome someone to talk to. Reduce your course load if you have to. "
755,3tvnoh,"Hey there,

I am also in ecse and in a similar situation, I admit you have more personal issues probably. I am not going to lie I am pretty scared myself. Are you also in ICE? pm me if you want a friend. I know I need one. If you got into Imperial, you have the brains. 

Being a British citizen, who moved to Ontario just for Grade 11 and 12 I can say that our curriculum is much much better than Canada's. I was at the university of sheffield myself before I restarted here as I did not want to lose my permanent resident status in Canada. (I was so disgruntled by Ontario High school, I took GCE A levels at a private school in Toronto instead).

As a result I am slightly older than everyone and having a horrible experience. 

I have failed a course before. My strategy is essentially if it happens again, fuck redneck education and go back to the old country, even if it means losing Canada's permanent residency. I can always get it later through my parents I guess.

If you are French (by the username), you could try British unis, as an EU citizen you would not pay that much and you would have a much much better experience and feel rewarded for the work you put in. It will be hard though, much harder than McGill exams but a 75% is often enough for the best grade and you would have ample time to study before your exams. Your finals would also typically count for more.

Hope it works out for both of us mate."
756,3tvnoh,"Don't feel bad about 263 with Xu.  Trust me, you're not the only one who don't understand him.  The man is legendary bad.  Unfortunately, bad lecturers are pretty much the norm.  I can count with one hand the number of good ones I've had in 5 years.

Not everything is dark and gloomy though.  Use McGill's Mental Health services, it will do you some good down the line.  Also to fight your loneliness, have you tried joining a club?  SSMU has a club for basically everyone and all of them are desperate for new members.  Engineering has a bunch as well, like the publications for examples."
757,3tvnoh,What ever you do the frustrations are not worth ending your life. If you have to I'm sure taking time off and going back home would be beneficial. Your parents will understand. 
758,3tvnoh,"I feel you buddy. I am in ECSE as well and my experience hasn't been great. Xu is the worst btw, I have never heard a single student compliment him. Shows course evaluation doesnt matter. Anyway I am kind of in the same boat. During high school I was on of the top students, and so was pretty much everyone in McGill. So that makes McGill a tough school. But still I think most McGill professor are research oriented and don't genuinely care about students. This affects a lot of students I know, and a lot like me loses their enthusiasm to learn. I suggest you take a smaller work load next semester and try to get back your passion for learning. Remember no matter how big of a burden you think you are (I fell like a pretty big one myself), your parents love you and no amount of wealth could replace  you, if you were not around."
759,3tvnoh,"Folks who cheat through their undergrad are pretty much guaranteed to be screwed later on, especially in STEM where understanding material is critical and cannot successfully be faked in a professional/grad school environment. If you're into /mischief/ you could probably report them and save them the peril later on."
760,3tvnoh,I see I did not know this.
761,3tvnoh,"Really do you get more time to study there? I am a French citizen even though I never lived in France for long. 

I have a lot of money to lose if I quit mcgill though."
762,3tvnoh,Copying answers for assignments isn't really blatant cheating (especially in math/stats/physics based assignments). I've had classes where it was nearly impossible to do every question on a assignment by yourself so you had to look at solutions/work with others. As long as these people aren't cheating on the final or major assignments that require original work It's not a big deal. Generally everyone I knew share these types of solutions/were happy to work together. So I see how it would suck if you were left out.   
763,3tvnoh,But how do you report people without being a snitch? We need an anonymous tipline for cheating.
764,3tvnoh,"Nah, what we really need is an incentive system like they have in prisons. Half a credit off your degree for every kid you catch copying stats solutions off Yahoo! Answers. "
765,3tvnoh,"Meh, copying published answers on assigned work (specifically in math/stats) isn't as bad as blatant cheating in exams or other assignments, which I have seen go unpunished."

770,3suk18,"Hey OP. I also lost a friend this year and I know how hard it can be. I'm sorry for your loss, this is a really horrible thing. I think you should go speak to your advisor and see what they have to say. If you can do something about your exams, do it. You first need to take care of yourself. I can tell you that it will be very hard at first but, as cliche as this sounds, things will be okay. If you need to talk about stuff feel free to message me. 

I don't think you should regret having chosen your current major because at least now you are sure of what you want. It is never too late to change something, especially when you know you will be happier in the long run. Don't give up OP. You can do it!"
771,3suk18,"That is not practical. I am very locked in due to many complicated reasons. If I had unlimited funds I would. 

I do not know how many friends I may have lost. I hope no more. Not having a big family due to unfortunate events and having no one here, living alone has been very hard for me.

And now one of the few friends I had is gone. I had been to mental health before and they were not very helpful. They talk but it is just logical stuff I knew already."

My self confidence is ruined. I already have so many deep troubles bothering me recently. This is just horrid. "
774,2mhy34,"Dude. Same. However, I've had psychiatric problems in the past, so now I just suck it up. I'm tired of feeling helped *and* helpless. 

If you haven't dealt with mental issues prior to this, I would suggest taking control. Perhaps starting by seeing a counselor, going to the McGill meditation center, gym, etc. before the psych clinic. If you do start to feel too helpless, that you're really losing control, go see a psychologist. Never lose control of yourself, no matter how easy McGill makes it to do just so. 

Cheer up buddy, McGill students are made of steel ;) and in the end, just fuck it

PM me if you need to talk!"
775,2mhy34,You should make a mental health appointment and let a professional who is trained in evaluating this sort of thing let you know what you should do. 
776,2mhy34,"In addition to seeing someone, work on it yourself!  It's not a matter of appointment vs. total sucking up.  You can see someone AND work on coping strategies like deep breathing, meditation, going to the gym, etc.  That may sound stressful on top of your work, but just try breathing deeply and counting the seconds you hold your breath (you decide how long is relaxing) with your eyes closed for five minutes.  You might find it reinvigorates you!

Disclaimer: Meditation will not cure a mental health issue, see a professional and use these tools as a supplement."
777,2mhy34,"I can 100% relate. If you have concerns about your mental health, a mental health appointment is warranted. Professional help isn't magic though.

Convince yourself that your mental state is a priority - above studying even, and take inventory of your physical health which (surprise) affects your mood and energy level. Is your diet good? Are you sleeping regularly? When's the last time you did cardio? Focussing on these can help break the negative/absent feels loop.

This isn't really an and/or situation. You should do everything you can to take care of your noggin, which may include an appointment with an expert.

Best of luck, we're pulling for you.

I've been through what you're talking about and what really helped me was to find new ways of engaging the material. Try going to the physical society colloquia, go hang around in the undergrad labs and play with stuff, go talk to one of your profs about their research and see if there are any relations between what you're studying and what they do.

786,1c7yw7,">What I don't understand is why is there no student solidarity? Not only that, I find students automatically side with the university or professors whenever there is a conflict. Why automatically assume they're right when you don't know the full story?

I have to ask - isn't this solidarity? Why would this be a positive thing when applied to students? 

The constant pushing of ""solidarity"" during the student strike bothered me for this reason. There is a zero percent chance of me pretending to agree with you just because we have *some* common interests, or *some* other points of agreement. Solidarity will be automatic if you have a cause that people actually believe in."

Because, most of the time, it's not an ""us vs them"" issue, and the logic of the administration kicks the ass of the pseudo-logic that some of the groups on campus try to shove down my throat without the opportunity for discussion or debate.  

Tuition increases.  I'll leave it at that."
788,1c7yw7,"Reputation is largely based on research capabilities, not the services provided to students, otherwise yes McGill would not even be close to the top. The reason is that the university consistently gets fucked over by the lack of funding that nearly all other top reputable institutions have. The administration has actually done quite a GOOD job in helping McGill rise in international reputation, especially under HMB. We were 18 in the world at one point.


They are doing the best they can with the funding that is given, a lot of student services would be improved if we could just get more money, but clearly the Quebec government has its interests elsewhere. If you can't attract strong administrative and academic staff to the university because you can't pay them a decent salary and promise them progression, then your reputation will continue to decline as it is currently doing. 

And if you're wondering what you're paying for (especially if you're an international), you're paying for the education of the other Quebec students at the other universities. I believe they're changing that or are in the process of giving McGill more of the money that it brings in, but historically it's been redistributed to everyone else."

Chicken Little, essentially. There've been too many appeals to ""student solidarity"" over things that are either a) bullshit (sit-in against the war in Iran) or b) something a lot of people are actually against (the student strike). So now any time somebody throws the word ""solidarity"" around people assume it's one of those two situations and turns off."

794,1c7yw7,"PRIVATIZE MCGILL! 

i say that half seriously, but still because funding is a huge issue and is the main issue. McGill is in a special place where the we get cut after cut after cut from our financial backing. 
And through the years, you see regulation and funding for the student side of the school transition to SSMU , where the money is broken up and the different faculties, which separates faculties separated from each other because of the lack of a centralized expense entity that is focused on the needs of the students rather than support the loudest, and most radical political viewpoints. 
The other thing is calling it solidarity, and how we need solidarity....solidarity is for protesting oppression, not for building school spirit. We as a school lack school spirit out right. When was the last time any of us attended a sports game, or anything intercollegiate and was proud to be a mcgillian because of the experience we have obtained at mcgill, and not because of QS rankings or a simpson's quote that's been blown out of proportion. 

anyways. exams. blah.

privatize mcgill, fix the money issue and slowly begin to patch up this school, so we can actually focus on the students, not the political issues that will just piss everyone off. "

801,1c7yw7,">Also, I don't think everyone is actually informed of what the cause is. Maybe you are, but the majority of people aren't.

I agree that this can be a problem, my point is that solidarity is problematic no matter what side it's on - for these exact reasons. If I have more in common with fellow students, then I'll probably agree with them more often. I'm still not going to commit to solidarity ahead of time, I think there should never be any shame in expressing disagreement or choosing ""the other side"".

The point of solidarity is to present a unified face on an issue, isn't it? What if there is no unified face?"
802,1c7yw7,"I didn't say pseudo-science logic, I said pseudo-logic.  Be careful, you are putting a lot of words out there that I didn't say.

You are doing exactly what I resent, shoving your beliefs in my face.  Why can't you respect that I see the need for tuition increases, I have made an educated decision regarding where I stand on this issue.  You ""want me to recognize"" what you see as right, that's how you come across.  How about asking me what my reasons are for my stance, instead of telling me what you want me to think?  I'll take you-- and I mean you as an individual, not you in the plural sense, I'm not grouping you with the intellectuals like Noam Chomsky who support accessible education and are capable of debating the issue like an intellectual would, weighing the pros and cons and attempting to see both sides first-- I'll take you seriously when you enter a conversation like a mature, responsible adult capable of respecting that others may disagree with you- and realizing that it's perfectly okay if they do."
803,1c7yw7,"Low tuition isn't simply a matter of accessibility of education, and phrasing it like that is exactly the kind of disingenuous pseudo-argument that we had so much of last year. I acknowledge that there are respectable people with reasonable arguments in favour of tuition freezes or reduction, but there are also a ton of bad arguments that get air time.

It may seem unfair to focus on the most unreasonable segments of a group or movement, but those are the aspects that make solidarity so difficult. When you have large numbers of people supporting tactics like hard picketing that many people consider blatantly and wildly unjustifiable, that kind of controversy is what's going to polarize opposition."

Not necessarily so.  Just because you have a wide and diverse base of people disagreeing with you, it doesn't mean that they all have the same opinion, think the same thing, etc.  They may disagree with one another as well.  


How are you trying to understand your fellow students?  Really, you're making no attempt at all, you're just attacking people you disagree with, and your logic and understanding of the situation is drowning in cognitive dissonance-- you don't want to believe that you could be wrong, that you could have the wrong approach, that you are the one who is disrespectful in the situation, that you're building a case for people to label you as a hypocrite along with other prominent anti-administration students like Chris Bangs and last year's SSMU exec, and that there could be merit and value in what you appear to so vehemently despise-- agreeing on occasion with the administration, those faceless ""others""."
810,1c7yw7,"I went to counselling last week before it was even actual drop-in hours. I told them I was having a crisis and 10 minutes later, I was speaking to a counsellor. That has been my only experience with it, but I was satisfied."

The first time I went to drop-in hours I wasn't even having a crisis, I just wanted someone to talk to. They told me to come back in a hour, which I did. I talked to the intake counsellor and had an appointment set up the following week. They seemed to me to be wonderful, caring people who are doing the best they can. I also have friends who have used the Mental Health Service and had no problem there either. "
812,1c7yw7,"I agree with you, university administration is inherently shitty since their customers (students) leave after 4 years, and reputation is what guarantees more customers, not necessarily quality of education (although the two are related).

However, that said, I'm not sure it's fair for you to expect so much of the school's counselling or mental health service, especially when that is something that really should be taken care of by the healthcare system. Granted, money could probably be spent more responsibly, but even if that money were available, do you prefer more services or more (possibly better) professors and TA's to run more and smaller sized courses?

"
813,1c7yw7,"I think that's definitely not the case. Where's the money going? Salary figures are public. There are individual instances of waste and extravagance, but who honestly believes that we're throwing tens of millions of dollars down the drain for nothing?

It shouldn't be a trade off of course-size/TA's or mental health services. If they can't handle the capacity, maybe they shouldn't accept so many students. If you read an article about the situation of mental health/counselling from a couple years ago, absolutely nothing has changed.

I still don't understand where you are getting this assumption that it is the obligation of the university to provide health services. I agree with you that the early 20's are stressful and that universities should be concerned with the welfare of their students, but I find it hard to see that extends to the point where McGill should replace services either the government or their health insurance could pay for."
822,1ctlgj,"What's your current academic standing? 

An ""open secret"" at mcgill is that pretty much everyone gets one free deferral (as long as you have good academic standing and no history of pulling shady shit). Everyone makes mistakes -- who doesn't know someone who slept through their alarm, got the exam date mixed up, etc.

Student services and advising know this, and they make exceptions in these cases. You should go get a doctors note for sure and then visit advising. They may come off a bit harsh (you're in a grey area and they don't want people to think they can game the system) so be prepared to be questioned. But as long as you look sick, have a reputable doctors note, and visit advising the day before, you'll probably be fine.

Another option which I have heard about is going to a walk-in clinic off campus, pounding a gallon of milk and faking gastro.

831,1ctlgj,Where did you get the note and with what excuses? :) 
832,1ctlgj,"But you're the exception, not the rule. When people seek deferrals when they don't *actually* have a valid reason, they're playing with fire. Sure, you might get the chill advising person who's willing to cut you some slack, or you might see the jaded, stressed out advisor who's seen 25 other alleged sick kids coming in to defer. 

It's better to err on the side of caution than tell others, ""Nah bro you're fine."" Because there's a very real chance things won't work out."

837,1ctlgj,"That's awesome your grades are good! I'm optimistic about your case then. And you get the doctors notes from student health or mental health, then you go to advising to confirm the deferral. Best of luck!"
838,1ctlgj,"Yes they do give out notes, but I'm not as familiar with the process and don't feel comfortable giving advice on that matter. I do know of people who have gone to mental health though. If you're not actually depressed/mentally ill, be prepared to commit yourself to the ""long game,"" so to speak. Mental health services may recommend you come in for counselling or follow up stuff. Just FYI. "
839,1ctlgj,Alright. Were you able to get your exam deferred?
840,1ctlgj,"You're awesome, thank you!"
841,1ctlgj,"Given what I wrote below, I just want to reiterate the obvious: no matter who you go to, you are PLAYING WITH FIRE. Odds are you'll get the deferral and everything will be fine. But it's very possible that things may not work out the way you want (such as the doctor or counsellor writing you a note that you ""claimed to have symptoms X, Y, Z but your temperature or other observed stuff came back fine."") With no proof, medical or otherwise, there is no real reason for an advisor to back up your request for deferral. 

Not trying to scare anyone, but I know of times where people have tried to defer and it didn't work out. Weirdly enough, it's been the sleep-ins who have never encountered issues... So fuck if I know. "
842,1ctlgj,I was :) through Mental Health though because waiting for the doctors took too long. 
843,1ctlgj,"Even with a ""bad"" academic standing like mine, I still go my exam deferred, so you should be perfectly fine."
844,1ctlgj,Nice :) How long did you have to wait at mental health and what did you say to them?
845,1ctlgj,"It was a super short wait, about 10 minutes. For an emergency visit, you only get 5 minutes with them. My guy asked me what was wrong, I told him that I've had a lot this term and that my illness has prevented me from studying properly. He asked how many deferrals I needed and gave me a medical note. The whole talk lasted 5 minutes. "
846,1ss5mz,If you've already been diagnosed with a stress disorder it should be very easy to get a deferral note from McGill Mental Health. I got one 2 years ago for an acute stress incident. 
847,1ss5mz,"Yes, do it. McGill basically (unofficially, and probably varies by program) gives you one freebie deferred exam, though they'd obviously never advertise that. I had an issue 2 years back where I took 2 classes outside my major on top of a already full course load. The exam I deferred was a large management lecture. It was accepted but my favorite part was I sent an email to my professor informing him of my decision and why, plus apologizing, in case it caused him any grief. He sent me this email back and it was maybe the best thing he could have said. Keep in mind this was a incredibly intelligent professor of a large lecture who had shown very little concern for student stress:

Sorry to hear that [my name],
 
We can get together after Jan 9th and see what we can do
 
I am sure we will find something that will work for you
 
In the meantime keep your spirits up
 
There are things much more important than a course or two
 
Cheers my friend,

[Prof]


Anyway, I thought it was awesome and actually helped me through a number of other stressful times. So don't get too caught up in it."
848,1ss5mz,"Do it! Do not stress yourself out! It's not worth it. 
And besides it's not like you're asking for too much."
849,1ss5mz,"If you are going to defer one of the Tuesday ones, you might as well defer both. Usually doctor notes are for a certain day, and also it would be strange if you are mentally unable to attend one of your exams but is fine for the other one 4 hours apart."
850,1ss5mz,"You should definitely be able to get a note from McGill mental health. However, if they are booked right now (which they probably are), talk to your regular mental health care provider, get a note, and bring it to your academic adviser. He or she should be able to sort things out from there. "
851,1ss5mz,"They are very understanding at the Mental Health Clinic.  It's honestly a great place to seek mental health help.  I graduated from McGill and I honestly can't find a good place like that.  I deferred a few exams with note from Mental Health (there will be a questionnaire for you when you go,specify you need a note as only psychiatrist can write it for you) and usually it works with no problem.  "
852,1ss5mz,"If you've been diagnosed, it's good to get a deferral if your anxiety/stress/etc will be negatively affecting your mindset.

As for your exam schedule itself... Welcome to McGill."
853,1ss5mz,"I don't think a doctor's note for being sick is really the same as an anxiety disorder, since it is the amount of exams in one period that is causing his/her anxiety. In the past, I've been able to defer one exam when I had two that day on the basis of depression/too many exams at once (although my professor had actually reached out to me and brought up the idea), so OP should be able to. So on that note as well, professors too have a lot of power in making decisions about deferrals (assuming they are tenured and not just a course lecturer) - it's definitely helpful to keep them informed throughout the semester when your grades are being affected by mental issues."
854,1ss5mz,"You're right. I was thinking about physical illness. 

My friend got help from McGill Mental Health once when they were really suffering from anxiety, and was able to waive the entire class around finals season. I think it's still on their transcript, but there is no grade."
855,1ss5mz,"To do this requires you to have a pretty public breakdown in front of the right people.

It's not fun.  I really don't recommend it."
856,16uq7d,Nothing to contribute; I just hope you feel better. 
857,16uq7d,"One thing with the mental health clinic, is they also do drop in. They have really good psychiatrists on site as well, so I would suggest just going there for drop in (and schedule a meeting on waitlist as well)

ISS will cover it, as long as you go to one after a referral from a doctor (or the people from the mental health clinic source:http://www.mcgill.ca/internationalstudents/sites/mcgill.ca.internationalstudents/files/guide_dassurance_pour_les_etudiants_etrangers_ang_2012-2013_2.pdf    page 7)"
858,16uq7d,There is a psychiatric emergency department at the [Douglas Mental Health Institute] (http://goo.gl/maps/JglmC) in Verdun which is affiliated with McGill. It may be a little out of the way for you but you are guaranteed to be seen by a psychiatrist at least once since they do not refuse any patient. 
859,16uq7d,"Counseling Services and Mental Health are two separate departments, confusing I know.  You can see a counselor much faster than someone from Mental Health, and you can also use their service while you're on the waitlist (but you can't use both at the same time).

I hope you find the help you need!"

861,16uq7d,"Doctor Phil McGraw.

He can be extremely hard to get an appointment with though."
862,16uq7d,"Same here, good luck."
863,16uq7d,"Dissenting opinion here, I had universally terrible experiences with the on site psychiatrists at the mental health clinic (I met with 3 different ones in the time I was at McGill). Some of their non MD therapists are great though; I don't mean to discount the drop-in services in general, just the shrinks."
864,16uq7d,"The 107 bus goes from Peel + des Pins to the hospital, so it's only like 35m by bus."
865,16uq7d,"Also if you feel there's a danger of self-harm just go to the ER of any hospital, e.g. Royal Vic "
866,14x223,"Go see an adviser and he will tell you if you can get a deferral. You know, if you have a family doctor you should really talk to him, because depression is a serious illness and with the proper documentation they can't refuse a deferral. (Also you can get treatment, depression and panic attacks are awful and I'm sure you'd rather not experience these feelings.)

Right now, check if any of those two classes have supplementary exams. If you fail you can take that exam and you'll have time to study for it. If you really feel there is no way you can pass both exams, focus on just one and take a deferred or supplemental exam for the other. Without a valid medical reason they don't have to accept your deferral, but I hear they give a freebie.

Good Luck."
867,14x223,"As I understand it, if you feel it is absolutely urgent you see Mental Health Services (but for something non-life threatening since otherwise you should always call 911 or go directly to a hospital), you can walk in at any time between 9am and 3h30 pm (Monday - Friday) and they will make an assessment with a possible follow up appointment.

I believe in order to defer your exam, you need a doctor's note. I'm not sure if Mental Health Services provides those, but I know for sure Health Services does. Don't worry about rushing to do this if you really are going through a tough time of it since you don't need to submit this note until the 15th of January. That said, you are going to need a valid reason for the doctor to issue such a note.

When you have it, bring it to your student affairs office (varies by faculty, unless you're Arts and Science in which case go to ServicePoint).

If you just need someone to listen or for serious advice, nightline is a great service: 514-398-6246

EDIT: Grammar and forgot to mention M-F only for MHS."
868,14x223,"I really don't know anything about deferral process so I can't answer your question... but one bad grade isn't going to affect you a whole lot & almost everyone fails an exam... you can pull through and do this, OP, believe in [yourself!](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbmlh3R8Ud1qe49wpo1_400.gif) (:"
869,14x223,"I'm a little late but I had an exam deferred for similar reasons last year. I had a note from a psychiatrist and I am also registered with the office for students with disabilities so all that worked in my favor. I'd recommend going to McGill Mental Health (as incompetent as I find them..) for the time being to get a doctor's note, make a deferral request online, and bring your note to service point ASAP as your proof.

 Then, I'd ask for a referral from Mental Health Services to an outside psychologist/psychiatrist so you can get yourself treated/helped should the depression continue. If depression continues to be a problem for you, I would recommend applying to the OSD. They have drastically improved my time at McGill. "
870,14x223,I'm really sorry you feel this way man. Try whatever you can to cheer up.

889,bht4be,"My first thought the second I walked out of my last exam last week was ""god, now I can finally learn how and what I want"", followed by unspeakable relief. I have found the ""course structure"" approach to be a horrible corruption of the underlying pure process of learning. Reading a physics or math book alone without any stakes is an almost spiritual experience: ""here, within these pages, are literally written the secrets of the universe, for most of human history wars would have been fought for this lump of paper I hold in my hand"". Yet put this same material in a classroom situation, with 400 other people next to you, some on facebook, with a professor who's tired of teaching this stuff for the 8th time, add to this stakes of exams and you get a truly horrifying distortion. Most of what I liked learning, I learned alone during my summers. I will not miss this place.

I wish you a happy and fulfilled life."

906,bht4be,"I am not sad,  but grateful and optimistic

908,bht4be,"Not to be the devil advocate but it’s just a graduation. It’s not like it mean anything, if he/she was in computer science she probably could’ve learned everything by self studying, the diploma is just credential that you did it supervised.

University and cegep/college are just cash grabs to fund teachers research because their research suck and are irrelevant so they can’t find their funds by themselves."
909,bht4be,Where I m from universities are worse and people are worse. McGill is hard and that's ok. I never cared about the prof/TA or some cocky person in class.

Thanks for your help!"
915,bji5ld,"Hi, I’m very sorry to hear about your situation. It may help if you visit a therapist or counselor and get some kind of statement from them validating the experience and the effect the trauma has had on you. Beyond this, I’m not sure what kind of documentation they could possibly ask for?

Also, if you ever want someone to talk to my DMs are open. I’m an assault survivor as well."
916,bji5ld,"Did you apply for a leave of absence? Not sure when the deadline is for that. All you need is a doctor's note.
I started looking up the process for readmission (which i don't think is what you mean), but have yet to do it. You should probably ask your department or supervisor/advisor about readmission process."
917,bji5ld,"The best way to get a doctors note for something like this is to go to the McGill walk-in clinic to see a doctor, ask the GP for a referral for emergency psychiatric services, and you should be able to see a psychiatrist the same day who can write you a note (and maybe provide some guidance for you—I know what you’re feeling, I’m an assault survivor as well)."
918,bji5ld,"I'm sorry to hear that. I would say go to your advisor ASAP and let them know about your situation because they will be part of the readmission process. Whether you're staying in Montreal or going back home, you can get medical documentation from a psychologist/psychiatrist explaining your situation, recommending how many classes to take next year, and setting up a treatment plan that's going to help your second year be relatively better. Medical documentation needs to be provided as a hard copy so you have to personally give it to the readmission office or mail it from home unopened and sent from the clinic/medical center it's coming from. The readmissions office will send you an email with rules and guidelines that you have to abide by for your second year and you'll probably be doing part-time for a year to adjust. Good luck."
919,bji5ld,Thank you and just to understand if I get readmitted do I repeat my previous year?
920,bji5ld,Sending all the love I can.
921,bji5ld,I would suggest asking your advisor. they'll help you build a schedule.
922,be3w7s,"McGill/OSD likes to believe that just because they offer stopwatch time, NTCs and extra time on exams, it’s somehow solving all the barriers that ALL people with disabilities face. Even for mental disorders, it doesn’t get to the heart of the barriers for most people. 

I’d look into academic literature on the social versus medical models of disability, for anyone struggling to make sense of their condition against the mindset McGill takes on disability. Many students have pointed out the failure McGill has done to foster a welcome learning environment for those with physical or mental conditions."
923,be3w7s,"I've mentioned this here before but since I restarted taking medication^1 I've realized what I'm good at studying. Reading heavy classes are a pain for me cause it takes me wayyyy longer than normal to read. I switched into Economics and maths after my first year here and it's so much better for me. I am more engaged with the content and I feel way more efficient studying for it.

Also, the OSD fucking sucks. I've been playing with the idea of forming an OSD student board/some sort of OSD student representation (if there isn't already). Everyone seems to have the same problems with them and I don't see anything being done about it. Also, while their accommodations are nice, they feel a little indelicate. I feel like things like notetaking and extended time on exams make classes easier, as opposed to accommodating disabilities, if you know what I mean. Then again, I'm an Econ student, so what do I know?

Hot take: taking study drugs without a diagnosis/prescription is academic dishonesty. It trivializes/cheapens the experience of people with actual ADHD and is a shitty practice that McGill turns a blind eye to.


1: I took concerta from age 9-14, when in my first year of high school my parents found out I smoked weed and they decided having access to a high risk drug (stimulants) was not something I could be trusted with (you can laugh, it's a funny situation, I don't hold any resentment or anything). I started again my senior year of high school."
924,be3w7s,"What I will say is that people really assume that you're not as intelligent as they are when you have ADD. You don't even have to tell them that you have ADD for that to be the case--people will judge you for having difficulty taking notes or forgetting things regularly. 

My ADD is not that severe compared to OP, but I still get judged for being relatively out of it. Like yah dawg, I had no clue the test was this week, but that doesn't mean I'm intellectually less than you are for not being organized, or that I'm going to do poorly in the class. 

Medication helps a lot but then people stigmatize you for needing drugs to cope. We should all recognize that as students, we have different circumstances. There's no one size fits all to doing your best."
925,be3w7s,Thank you for posting ♥️♥️
926,be3w7s,"I have ADHD (diagnosed when young as well) and do relatively well in school. Going into my last year here in September (done exams!). 

My biggest piece of advise is -- controversially -- to try to work without using medication. I have been on various amphetamine drugs (including Vyvanse) so the following comes from experience: these drugs will help you outwardly ""calm down"", but they do not really help you process or understand information better. Anyone who has been on amphetamines will confirm that you're legit ""high"" on these drugs. Personally, I felt my thinking was always clouded. I still use meds rarely, but not for studying -- more for anxiety or when I have a panic attack like situation.

Instead, starting in the last year of high school, I stopped using meds for class/school. It's a lot harder to focus and pay attention, but I feel like I retain and understand the information a lot better. I use short-term goal setting (things to do this week, things to do today, things to do this hour, etc.) to refocus myself. I have a sticky note on my desktop and a notebook I carry around where I have these goals listed. I use this in combination with frequent (really frequent) breaks to cover the material. I also found it really important to study on my own, without help from friends/profs/TA. People help you understand concepts, but I always found this was outweighed by the distracting effect they had on me. I would pay more attention to my prof than to the material, if that makes sense. I do not know if these will work for you or others, but I hope you are able to find some sort of non-medical refocusing tool to manage your ADHD. 

Importantly, I am not against the use of amphetamines. They have helped me a lot. I do, however, believe that we ADHD people use these drugs too much and over rely on them because they are so effective. Honestly, 2 months after I stopped being a daily user (which I was for all of high school) I felt 10x smarter. Like I had been in some sort of stupor before.

Other piece of advice is to study things which are naturally interesting to you (refocusing is much easier) and things which you have some intuitive grasp of. Reading -- which I sucked at for all of high school, and still struggle with a bit -- helps a lot too in terms of trying to train attention. Ultimately, I believe a lot of effort can mitigate some of the downsides with ADHD. I've seen this with many of my friends. Of course, this is not to disparage people with severe forms of the disorder who practically need meds all of the time. Have met people like this too.

For me, I knew this is something I had to deal with in uni as most employers are even worse than OSD. I have heard some bad stories from older friends on how little their employers care about the disorder. Hope some of this helps, feel free to send me a pm."
927,be3w7s,Absolutely. And now requiring people to schedule their own OSD finals definitely isn't helpful to us with organizational and time management issues.
928,be3w7s,Absolutely agree ! Not to mention OSD is a stressful environment and people there are not at all welcoming or mindful of the students. It’s like some of these people don’t even know they’re dealing with people who have disabilities like anxiety and are making it worse :/
929,be3w7s,">McGill/OSD likes to believe that just because they offer stopwatch time, NTCs and extra time on exams, it’s somehow solving all the barriers that ALL people with disabilities face.

Yeah, they talk about how they're ""levelling the playing field"" and all that, but they're not even close, and sometimes they seem borderline ignorant on the issue that they're supposed to be dedicated to.

It also doesn't help that they couldn't schedule an exam and/or communicate properly (read: at all) if their lives depended on it.

I'm glad I don't have a physical disability - in a lot of ways I think that would be even worse."
930,be3w7s,">Also, the OSD fucking sucks. I've been playing with the idea of forming an OSD student board/some sort of OSD student representation (if there isn't already).

I would 100% go in on that."

935,be3w7s,Always a pleasure 🥰
936,bn86i8,"Idk the answers to your questions but in regard to staying as a visitor and working the answer is a HARD no and you might not want to even ask such a thing bc the idea of staying in Canada as a visitor and working without a visa for cash is ILLEGAL. You have to pay taxes. If you do work without a visa/for cash and you get caught, you will be removed from the country and not allowed entry for I believe a MINIMUM of a year, maybe more."
937,bn86i8,"I've navigated a vaguely similar situation.

The conditions of your study permit are that you are a full time student. If you are no longer enrolled at McGill, you will have to leave Canada.

You definitely cannot stay as a visitor and work, as others here have said. If you do want to work, you're going to have to get a work permit that's independent of your study permit (which will no longer be valid). I think someone here suggested a PR but I think that might be harder for you to get. In any case, going for the work permit or the PR is going to be difficult in Quebec if you don't speak french or have any qualifications/skills/job offers unfortunately :/ 

This is a tough situation, I can sympathize with having trouble due to emotional issues, I was in a similar boat.

One thing that might be an option for you is to apply to Concordia, take classes there, do well, and try to reapply to McGill. In my opinion this is probably your most realistic chance of staying in Montreal.

I would go to the international students office for advice, they've likely seen this before.

I want to stress that you will have to leave the country soon after your enrollment is terminated, the penalties for failing to do so can be severe."
938,bn86i8,"you can apply for PR but you need to be fluent in French (B2/B2 level). preparing for French exam will take a long time (depends on person. but going to take at least one year-year and a half) in order to receive a document called CSQ. once you pass french exam with B2/B2 scores and apply for CSQ,  you need to wait more than a year for it to be processed. after long wait and if you manage to receive CSQ, then you apply for PR and this will take another 18-20months. so basically, if you wanna become PR, you need to spend almost 2.5-3 years. so i would say becoming PR wont be a good idea. and for the cashjob, ive heard some restos are still offering cashjobs but if you get caught (and especially when you are international student or with visitor visa), there’s high chance that you’ll get deported. it sounds harsh but you can still apply for visitor visa and just take semester off and then apply for readmission and once you get accepted then you apply for new student visa + CAQ."
939,bn86i8,"There is of course the danger of not being accepted to Concordia once being kicked out of another university because of marks.  
OP could apply to a CEGEP program though."

I would suggest you talk with the OSD they can help you navigate the process of disclosure and help you talk with the dept...however don't depend on them 100% you will need to be an advocate for yourself !!

Some Departments are a bit strict but if you register with the OSD and explain the situation they(your dept) should be able to work with you to find accommodation that works for your program .... unfortunately some programs  require that you take classes in a particular order and only offer them in certain semesters (ie fall only or winter only)...I don't know how it works in regards to your visa but if you have documentation provided to the OSD then you technically could be considered full time time while taking a reduced course load. 


Its not unheard of to take extra time to complete a masters degree however you will be expected to pay (its a fixed fee for ""continuation"") 

Best of Luck , It can be frustrating  sometimes to navigate the system but don't give up and DO NOT take NO for an answer, administrators and departments  at McGill can sometimes be a bit to stubborn , take the time to get to know your dept graduate  coordinator as they will be your main point of contact..."
949,alu58n,"Congrats on your acceptance! 

As for your question, it would be easier for us to help you if you mention which department you were accepted into. I assume by the course load this is a course-based Master's program and not a thesis Master's?"
950,alu58n,"Accommodations can be made, but if you're worried about not making the full-time student status, which is critical for your study permit you need to talk to three people - the departmental grad student coordinator, the office for students with disabilities, and international student services. I believe the three year limit is actually from the government, not McGill (but I may be wrong.) I think you have understood correctly, but those are for people without accommodations so you need to ask around if you have different rules"
951,alu58n,[deleted]
952,alu58n,I did a masters in eco last year and as far as I know 9 credits is considered full time for grad school. You might want to check with the department to confirm
953,alu58n,"I don't think you need to worry about part time/full time as much in graduate school for the visa. I did my undergraduate degree at mcgill and am now at another canadian university (so maybe check for certain that the policies are the same). I've never seen an official policy for full time/part time credit hours in grad, but at one point my department secretary told me I had to register for two classes (aka, two seminars worth 6 credits total). Last semester I ended up with 13 credits, so that would be over the minimum technically, but this semester I only have 9. As you said, with your program requiring only 45 credits you could average out to 9 per semester and still graduate on time. I believe my program only totals to something like 20 credits and most people complete it in two years (I will finish all my coursework here in one year) so most people spread it out even more, including the internationals. worst comes to worst, i'm sure there is some ""independent study"" course your department could enroll you in (for example, one of my courses this semester is a thesis writing credit, so obviously i'm doing work for it but at my own pace. there are also ""independent reading"" courses in the humanities, not so sure about similar things in mathematics).

TLDR, i dont think the credit hours/visa will be a big issue, maybe just check in with your department to be sure."
954,alu58n,"You can technically still submit your thesis after 3 years, you just lose student status AFAIK. (someone please correct me if I'm wrong). "
955,alu58n,"Thank-you for your reply; it is very much appreciated. However, I cannot really find any information pertaining to my situation on the McGill OSD website. They appear to focus on ""accommodations"", but I am not sure whether what I ask is in that category. I guess what I need is for McGill to recognize me as a full time student even if I take less than 12 credits for some semesters. Other posters below have indicated that graduate students might not be classified full time/part time according to the same conditions as undergraduates (12 credits a semester). Do you know about this?"
956,alu58n,"*Its not unheard of to take extra time to complete a masters degree  however you will be expected to pay (its a fixed fee for ""continuation"")*

What do you mean by ""continuation""? As far as I have understood there is a fixed tuition ([https://www.mcgill.ca/student-accounts/tuition-charges/fallwinter-term-tuition-and-fees/graduate-fees](https://www.mcgill.ca/student-accounts/tuition-charges/fallwinter-term-tuition-and-fees/graduate-fees)), only depending on the type of student (from Quebec, from Canada outside Quebec, and international). I'm an international student."
957,alu58n,"Thank-you! The program is in mathematics. The Master's is thesis based: 24 credits of courses (so 6 of 4 credits), 21 credits for the thesis."
958,alu58n,"I found this:  *""Full-time students are students with a registration status of full-time  and paying full-time fees.

965,alu58n,"It's not explicit, but if you look at this page https://www.mcgill.ca/gps/students/registration/progress/time-limitation, it says that ""Students can apply for readmission by completing and submitting the Request for Readmission webform only when they are ready to submit their thesis and will be charged fees for the term of readmission and any future terms of registration up to and including their term of graduation."""
966,alu58n,"Oh I see! Yes, this program even required me to find an advisor beforehand (and it requires a thesis).

""Also be aware that Canada does discriminate against people with disabilities who are seeking citizenship""

Can you elaborate? I'm not currently seeking citizenship, but maybe permanent residency. I imagined the primary hurdle would be to find work after graduation in Montreal, considering that I speak no French. And really I can only afford Montreal :') .

Again, thanks for taking some time to help me!"
967,alu58n,"Hmm, curious. But it also says that they have no obligation to readmit you, and that you must leave Canada. Interesting is:  *""Students can apply for readmission by completing and submitting the Request for Readmission webform only when they are ready to submit their thesis""*; does this mean that you can work alone on your thesis, get readmitted, and immediately graduate? That would be odd, since the thesis is 24 credits -- more than half the program -- and at any rate not something you could finish alone unless you were almost done."

969,alu58n,"yeah I think that's what it means. You will likely be working alone irregardless, with your supervisor supervising. "
970,alu58n,"Oh wow, that's insane. French speakers (from France, Wallonia) already have Quebec tuition; if you speak French you basically get PR for free.

I have nothing against French and would definitely be willing to learn it; it appears one needs B2 level, maybe that is feasible, I don't know. I never learned English formally either, just reading & TV. Thanks for the information.

I have done quite a lot of programming since I was a kid, but I have doubts this is good enough for a professional environment; the program is in pure maths too, it's completely esoteric."
971,alu58n,"You're currently doing an MSc in CS at McGill? How much credits is their thesis?

I don't know really how a MSc thesis is handled at McGill, but for so much time I cannot imagine they would let you completely loose. I should expect at least one (or maybe even two) meeting with the supervisor a week to discuss progress and questions. If you're not a student anymore, and living abroad, I'm not sure how much time a supervisor would want to spend on you."
972,alu58n,[deleted]
973,alu58n,"It's the same number of credits. A supervisor wants to get you published, I don't see any difference with overseas or not. You would do yourself a great service if you find a supervisor from the get-go who promises you that much time and attention per week. A good priority to have!"
974,apnnuu,"Hey man I took a year off that turned into more time off. However I did apply for readmission twice and was accepted both times. As long as you’re not in unsatisfactory standing you’re pretty much guaranteed to have your readmission application approved.

If you are in unsatisfactory standing I have heard you need to put concrete plans to improving your academics in your readmission form.

All in all dont sweat it. My time off was the best thing that happened to me and I’m in a much better place now."

977,apnnuu,no I'm mainly just afraid that I'm going to do really badly this semester and tank my GPA haha... 
978,apnnuu,Make sure you withdraw before the deadline. Late withdrawals are much more difficult to obtain. 
979,agswvv,"I don't think you need a lot of experience to apply for internships. As long as you know Java and you can solve basic problems, I'm sure you can find a decent position, at least something to begin with. (I got my first internship with only comp202 and no prior programming experience).

Side projects are nice, but its not easy to find time and motivation to work on those. You can show project that you did for school on your github, as long as you explain what was the goal and how you achieved it. Eventually just having internships on your CV will lead you to better internships.

Some of the best experience I got at McGill for industry were COMP321 or the competitive programming club and hackathons. If you are only going for a full time job after graduating, I wouldn't worry too much about your GPA. Keep some time for yourself too !"
980,agswvv,"I've been a CS student for a few years now, and I got my first few internships indeed precisely because I had done some good side projects, in particular I had written a self-hosting C compiler. If you actually love or care about programming, then finding motivation should not be hard, but from my personal experience what can be hard is to find (and decide to focus on) a particular topic since there are so many to chose from. For me, doing such projects is motivating because it is constructive and intellectually stimulating and you get improve your skills and learn new techniques. I started programming when I was 9 years old, started very small and learnt to write increasingly sophisticated programs, and when I'm in a good optimistic mood I like to think of it as a lifelong journey, although as you allude about yourself I have some self-esteem and mood stability problems, which I am sure McGill's heartless competitive nature has contributed a lot to. I think having something more than just a degree (could be side projects, could be internships, could be other things as well) will be useful (if not necessary) in the coming years in order to find jobs in the increasingly saturated and competitive field that this has become, so as to stand out from all the people trying to get by with as little as possible. Another factor for finding jobs is having good grades in your courses and having an overall positive, motivated, pro-active attitude."

You dont really need a super strong resume or github; other universities have their students do a coop in their 2nd semester of uni (they apply during their first semester)

Whether or not you decide to do an internship, a general tip is to keep getting better at your favourite language - learn a framework, create a full stack application, deploy your invention on an app store/aws
"
984,agswvv,"\- Fellow CS person here, felt the exact same way two years ago

\- yes I have done side project, and its true that it is hard to do them for full-time student. But keep in mind that they don't have to be big, they can just be a quick hack project for the duration of a weekend

\- motivation comes from your interest. What are you interested in? (Chess? Reading? music?) build things related to things you are interested in.  Is there a technology that you are always curious about, or want to demystify? (angular was one for me)

\- YES, APPLY! keep in mind most CS internship, you dont need a ton of experience,  COMP 250 knowledge will do for most job interviews.  Even the big companies have internships for newbies.

All the major academic policies at McGill (e.g. Code of Student Conduct) were initially adopted by Senate. Undergraduate student senators fill 13 seats out of the 111, the remainder filled by Professors, Deans, Staff and University Administrators. Moreover, each of us is also sitting on 2-3 Senate and/or University committees in order to voice students' concerns to the different stakeholders, from Enrolment Services to Student Services. We are also working on various projects oriented towards improvements to the student experience at McGill.

Very difficult to say which committee is the most impactful at Senate. From what I heard from my fellow Student Senators, most committees are very open to students' opinions and ideas, which often translates to better policies and projects for the McGill community.

I would say our allies are very often other Senators, whether professors or staff. A lot of Senate members will often say that they appreciate the work Student Senators do as they are ""the life of the party"" during meetings.

Reggie - Law Senator

EDIT: It really depends on what you mean by impactful. Technically speaking, the highest level Senate committees have the most ""power"" but often the work that gets brought to these committees actually happens in their subcommittees.

On top of that, it depends on where your priorities lie. If you're most impacted by changes to enrolment processes, the Enrolment and Student Affairs Advisory Committee may be most important to you. On the other hand, if expanding mental health resources is most important, the Committee on Student Services will be the most impactful. According to the University, the Academic Policy Committee has the most raw power with relevance to Senate's mandate as an academic governing body. Here's link to the Senate standing committees and their terms of reference: [https://mcgill.ca/senate/committeesofsenate/senate-standing-committees](https://mcgill.ca/senate/committeesofsenate/senate-standing-committees)

In terms of allies, it really depends on the issue. For the divestment movement a pretty easily identifiable group of allies was present because many of them had been working on it for years before it came to a vote in Senate, but I don't foresee that always being the case. Upper admin in general does tend to act more for their own self preservation than for student rights, in my personal opinion. 

Sorry that these answers seems so non-answer-y but that's honestly the way it is.

1031,9qfizt,"Thanks for this question!  


So, if the purpose is to get students to take hard classes outside of their comfort zones, then it definitely doesn't In fact, this change might just help to encourage more students to take a class S/U! If the purpose, however, is for school to be some weird kind of gambling game where we care more about what option you chose at the beginning of the year, for some arbitrary reason, when you had never taken a biology class or a sociology class before, then, I would agree, it does. I'm hoping that the system was designed with the former objective in mind. It was at Columbia, and that is why they changed their [policy](https://www.college.columbia.edu/facultyadmin/grading): ""The purposes of this option are to encourage students to take courses of interest to them outside of the field of specialization and to permit those who have not decided upon a major to test their talents in a particular field that may be of interest""  


This idea is that it allows students to take a hard class that they otherwise wouldn't just as the ""S/U"" option did before. Yet, it now accounts for the fact that midway through the semester you may actually be interested in the class and start doing well. Instead of feeling bad or trying to calculate how much effort to put in so that you don't feel like an idiot for taking it S/U, you can just go for it! Alternately, you don't have to. It is about encouraging students to take classes outside their comfort zone and then giving students to get recognition for their efforts and results, if they want.   


\-- Jacob (VP University Affairs)"
1032,9qfizt,"Hey! Not quite sure what you mean by your second question. It's a personal project of the SSMU VP UA and has been brought to the Enrolment and Student Affairs Advisory Committee (University level). To answer your first question, there is precedent at other universities including Yale and Columbia.

\- Madeline, Arts Senator"
1033,9qfizt,"(Also a reply to u/The12thDoc.) The idea is that if students do well in an elective course they thought they would do poorly in, they'd be able to change the Satisfactory grade (not counted toward GPA) to an A (counted toward GPA), for example. 

The proposed change would allow students to retroactively boost their GPA in these courses. This wouldn't snowball into something students use for every course since you can only opt for S/U in electives.

 If you use S/U to lighten the effective workload of a course, then yeah, this does defeat the point of S/U. But if you use S/U as a cautionary measure on courses you plan to do all the work for but don't know if you'll do well in and don't want a potential poor grade in to lower your GPA, then this allows you to be rewarded for your work if you end up doing well. Helps those in the latter situation without hurting those in the former. 

Hope this answered your questions!

\- Madeline, Arts Senator"
1034,9qfizt,It usually happens in November I think. When it's announced there will be a facebook event you'll probably see through the department groups and it will be in some of the broadcast emails.
1035,9qfizt,Here is the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/2190245197885794/?ti=as)
1036,9qfizt,"Some courses are difficult, that does not mean they are not intro courses. Almost every department in science wnd engineering has some hard courses in the first year."
1037,9qfizt,ya she lives in le château aint that ironic
1038,9qfizt,"You know how when you're in the early phases of setting goals for a project and you just let the torrent of all ideas flow forth so they can be refined pending feasibility? That's spitballing – brainstorming ideas.

From what you've given as reasons for pursuing this goal, it seems like a waste of time. Nothing you have said is justified because you and/or your SSMU handlers don't understand the concept of a grading system in the context of choosing courses to take as pass/fail. This is dressed-up GPA entitlement that the student body has not asked for. By chasing something so foolish without consultation of the student body you are not only misrepresenting us to McGill's admin but you're also damaging the legitimacy and reputation of future student senators. Decisions like yours are the reason why the administration does not take student opinion seriously.

edit: actually, you know what? why don't you and /u/b_bur join the mcgill discord and talk about it there too, because there's a lot of discussion happening that you should probably use to inform your clearly lacking decision-making process."
1039,9qfizt,"This sounds completely absurd. What is the meaning of achieving a good grade of there is no way of receiving a bad grade for the course ? S/U is supposed to be used as an incentive to take interesting but possibly challenging electives and that measure would strongly motivate people to instead use it as a way to pad their GPA. The very point of it is that your grade does not matter! 

It honestly sounds completely backwards. GPA boosting purely for the sake of GPA boosting accomplishes nothing positive except make some students happy on the short term, and devalues the work of students who take their education seriously by creating more opportunities for GPA inflation among students who play the system to maximize grades.

GPA is the grade point average and it should be the average of the grade points achieved by the student. A course in which the grade point scheme is ""either it doesn't count towards my GPA or it's a 4.0 that counts towards the GPA"" makes absolutely no sense in that context, in order for GPA to be representative of performance there has to be a downside in doing poorly if there is to be an upside in doing well otherwise you might as well just add 0.5 to everyone's GPA right now and call it a day.

I think a more reasonable measure would be to convert the S to an A or A- on the transcript if the student achieves those, without counting it in to the GPA."
1040,9qfizt,"> But if you use S/U as a cautionary measure on courses you plan to do all the work for but don't know if you'll do well in and don't want a potential poor grade in to lower your GPA, then this allows you to be rewarded for your work if you end up doing well. Helps those in the latter situation without hurting those in the former.

I don't see why the latter situation is one that needs to be helped. Part of choosing to take an elective course includes the judgement call of taking it S/U. You weigh the costs and benefits for yourself and you make the best decision before the deadline with the information you have. What is wrong with this system that it has to be improved?"
1041,9qfizt,[deleted]
1042,9qfizt,I joined the McGill discord and I explained the plan a bit more there. The VP UA will join in a bit later here to explain further.
1043,9qfizt,"I'm sorry that you feel that we're misrepresenting your interests - this isn't something we ever intend to do. The intent of this AMA was to expand our consultation to as many forums as possible so as to best represent our constituents' interests - thank you for expressing yours. 

That being said, this isn't my personal project, so I can't speak to the specific prior consultation done, but I do know that it wouldn't have arisen as a project in the first place unless it was a perceived interest of members of the McGill community. There are people who want this, but we will definitely take your points into consideration.

As a side note, referring to the SSMU VP University Affairs and President as the Senators' ""SSMU handlers"" was unnecessary and uncalled for. All members of Senate Caucus are equals. We're people, not pets.

\- Madeline, Arts Senator"
1044,9qfizt,"The S/U option exists so as to encourage students to take more challenging electives that may lie outside of their comfort zones. This proposed change would increase flexibility and student autonomy over their own grades. Sure, it is a small change. But, one in the right direction. It isn't about ""GPA boosting"". It's about providing students with an opportunity to be recognized for hard work in difficult classes that fall outside of their comfort zones. If an Arts student, for example, has enjoyed their Science elective and coming into the final knows that they could end up with an A, they should have the option to study hard and know that their work will be recognized. Equally, though, they also retain the option to not focus on the class and get the S instead. The intention behind this program is to popularize the S/U option, and allow students to take classes beyond their comfort zones with greater flexibility.

1045,9qfizt,"Introduction does not mean that it has to be at beginner level.

1046,9qfizt,"> I do know that it wouldn't have arisen as a project in the first place unless it was a perceived interest of members of the McGill community

There was no consultation via plebiscite on this, so I'm not sure how or why it arose as a project.

> As a side note, referring to the SSMU VP University Affairs and President as the Senators' ""SSMU handlers"" was unnecessary and uncalled for. All members of Senate Caucus are equals. We're people, not pets.

You may as well be, because you apparently can't think for yourselves to search for flaws in what you were pursuing. Why are we only learning about this initiative now that you've already started embarrassing the student body in front of the Enrolment and Student Affairs Advisory Committee?

1047,9qfizt,"But you do understand that people will simply abuse that option to take easy classes with the comfortable guarantee that they cannot get any grade lower than A counting towards their GPA, and that this will represent the large majority of the use for that option, right ?

Until now, people are held back from using the S/U option as a mindless GPA booster by the fact that while it cannot penalize their GPA, it cannot increase it, and that is the reason it is used to take interesting and challenging electives. Your measure would very much go against that. "
1048,9qfizt,"> It isn't about ""GPA boosting""

So will the proposed change involve the letter grade not counting towards the GPA?"
1049,9qfizt,"First, thanks for engaging on this issue. Positive feedback is great, but negative feedback usually proves more valuable in the long-run. Appreciate you engaging on this, even though you clearly don't seem to have much trust in this process. Thanks.

So, to be clear, I campaigned on this. In terms of consultation, I brought this up with students in every faculty and in about 70 different 1-1 conversations that I had while considering running for this position, including conversations with students that I know and those that I don't. In those conversations, I heard one negative comment and tweaked the proposal to respond to the concern raised. That being said, the more consultation the better. If it is really the case that many students think this is unnecessary or that it would be preferable to not have the grade count towards GPA, then I'll respond to that. I think this is a good, beneficial idea, but I'm not wedded to it and am happy to ditch it. I'm sure you would agree, though, that we would need more than three commenters here to prove that it is an ""embarrassment."" Acting on these comments, right now and as it stands, would strike me as both poor consultation and as also unfair to the students with whom I had conversations. I'm happy to think about how we can continue to gauge interest on this, and am open or responsive to suggestions from this forum. I'll work on thinking up some stronger consultative process on this topic and check back in by the end of the week, but please do let me know if you have any ideas!

I'd encourage those interested in or critical of this proposal to check out the policies at[ Columbia](https://www.college.columbia.edu/facultyadmin/grading) and[ Yale](https://yalecollege.yale.edu/new-students/transfer-students/general-academic-information/creditdfail-option). They were definitely the inspiration for this idea.

I also want to respond to the claim here that this proposal only offers upside, without no downside. Or, to quote from above: ""in order for GPA to be representative of performance there has to be a downside in doing poorly if there is to be an upside in doing well otherwise you might as well just add 0.5 to everyone's GPA right now and call it a day."" There is a downside. You can still get a ""U"".

Next, I want to respond to the idea that this will encourage more students to take S/U option. Yes, that is the goal! However, it should not be so quickly assumed that it will also encourage students to ""simply abuse that option to take easy classes with the comfortable guarantee that they cannot get any grade lower than A counting towards their GPA."" There is no value in taking easy classes under the ""S/U"" option. An ""S"" is often understood to be lower than an ""A""; it is also lower than an A-, B+, and arguably a B too. I get that students can avoid having a non-A counting towards their GPA, but they would still have an easy class with an ""S"" on their transcript. It is also worth mentioning that students are only able to take a maximum of 1 elective per year, and so it is very hard for this to become some huge grade inflation problem.

Fundamentally, I think students working hard in class that is difficult and outside of their comfort zone should be rewarded for it, should they end up doing well. I think most students would agree too. Is this a huge, landmark change? No. Is this something that could directly impact some students, improve the quality of learning by encouraging students to go outside their comfort zones, while not incurring any risk or downside? Ya, it seems likely. Again, this isn't about ""GPA boosting"". It is about encouraging students to take classes that they otherwise wouldn't. Should we pursue this idea, we would obviously track whether students end up taking more classes under the ""S/U"" option, which I think would be a good thing, and whether grades are inflated because of this, which I doubt will happen. I'm happy to address your concerns on this forum, by email, or in person. Sorry for the lengthy response. There is a good reason I don't have my own reddit account ;). Looking forward to continuing the discussion on this topic.

Thanks + Respectfully,

Jacob"

Actually I feel a bit disrespected by it so it has impacted the tone of the rest of this message, I apologize in advance.

okay now this is just absurd.
If you asked 100 students if they would rather have a 4.0 or not have a 4.0, do you think that would serve as a basis to implement a system where everyone has a 4.0? There is a limit to implementing things based on ""what students want"". 

>Acting on these comments, right now and as it stands, would strike me as both poor consultation and as also unfair to the students with whom I had conversations.

My understanding is that there was literally zero consultation for this except what was done during your campaign. If you are that worried about consultation, why are you not using the multiple different avenues that were specifically designed for that ? Besides, my understanding is that you are an executive. You don't, or at least should not need to consult people to think about the implications of this kind of change in the grading system.

> I'd encourage those interested in or critical of this proposal to check out the policies at Columbia and Yale.

Weren't we just talking about grade inflation being a big potential issue ?

There is a downside. You can still get a ""U"".

Okay now this is just frustrating. I am really sorry for being frustrated and I hope you will forgive my relative lack of civility here because it very honestly feels like either you're actively trying to dodge the questions or you actually put zero thought in this at all and are literally only pushing this because you campaigned on it which is honestly a very poor reason.

> There is no value in taking easy classes under the ""S/U"" option. An ""S"" is often understood to be lower than an ""A""; it is also lower than an A-, B+, and arguably a B too. 

And you want to change that. You want to add value to taking easy classes under the S/U option by allowing people to get an A that counts towards their GPA while not being able to be punished GPA wise for performing poorly.

>There is a downside. You can still get a ""U"".

This downside is objectively less punishing than getting a poor grade that counts towards your GPA. So compared to taking a course under the regular grading scheme, no, there is no downside.

>An ""S"" is often understood to be lower than an ""A""; it is also lower than an A-, B+, and arguably a B too. I get that students can avoid having a non-A counting towards their GPA, but they would still have an easy class with an ""S"" on their transcript. 

That is completely irrelevant given that a large number of scholarships and other opportunities are attributed based on GPA and the number of S you have literally does not matter at all for most of those.

>Fundamentally, I think students working hard in class that is difficult and outside of their comfort zone should be rewarded for it, should they end up doing well.A gain, this isn't about ""GPA boosting"". It is about encouraging students to take classes that they otherwise wouldn't. 

If you are thinking this, then why are you pushing a measure that does the exact opposite of that ?? Your measure literally starts punishing students for taking interesting electives because as of right now, there is no way to increase your GPA by taking a S/U course so it's a tool that is available for students who care about learning. There is thus zero downside in using your S/U option (which you get course a year with) on a hard course. If you change the system in the way you suggest, in order to compete with students who use it on an easy course at no GPA penalty, you will have to use it on easy courses as well if you don't want to be objectively losing out, which is literally the opposite of what you are claiming you want to do.

>Is this a huge, landmark change? No. 
 
Either this is too small to be relevant and then why is that one of your big goals, are there not more useful things to be thinking about ? Or it is important enough to have a significant effect on grade inflation and it should be considered carefully. Either way the idea is ridiculous on principle so the scale does not really matter.

> Is this something that could directly impact some students, improve the quality of learning by encouraging students to go outside their comfort zones, while not incurring any risk or downside? Ya, it seems likely. 

You are being delusional at this point. There is just no other word. I think the issue other people raised was not that suggesting this change was bad per se. It's honestly fine because this is never going to pass. The issue is that when senators state that this is one of their three priorities it makes the senate as a whole looks beyond ridiculous and I think it is not very nice of you to put honest people in that situation."

There are two classes of downsides to this, GPA, and economic. The current system has no GPA upside or downside, what you are proposing where an S can be converted to a letter grade would have a GPA upside but still no GPA downside. There are economic downsides as only students that can afford to re-take a U and make it an S or a letter grade will do so. This is perpetuating pay-to-play GPA ratcheting as students can just take an S/U Class a semester and re-take all their hypothetical U's until they get S' that can be converted to good letter grades.

1054,9qfizt,"> you clearly don't seem to have much trust in this process


but there was no process? you having conversations with mostly your friends is not a process. what we don't have faith in is you presenting half-baked ideas as meaningful/important policy initiatives. "
1055,9qfizt,"Currently there is zero upside in using this option to take easy electives, so it is being used for its intended purpose; taking potentially challenging electives. I think we will agree on that. People who are gunning for a 3.95+ GPA will not take classes that are difficult as S/U because they can't use that to increase their GPA;  if they have some catching up to do GPA wise, they are better off taking a ""bird course"" and achieving an A. There is a risk to this though because some bird courses end up being more challenging than planned and lowering those people's GPAs, although that is not very common. This risk is what makes it fair to allow students to boost their GPA by  cherry picking electives. 

If you were to change the grading system to allow students to get an A with the S/U option, then that risk would entirely disappear. Students going for 3.95+ GPAs could, once a year, take an easy elective course, with the absolute certainty that it cannot result in a GPA loss. Either they achieve the A and improve their GPA, or it does not count at all. They would thus be applying this system to ""bird courses"" that they would already have taken before with the aim of getting an A, but now with zero possible downside, resulting on this group of students overall achieving higher GPAs.

For a student going for a 3.95+ GPA, there would be no upside in taking a harder course with that option given that there is the opportunity to take the bird course, since the harder course is less likely to result in an A, and thus less likely to improve their GPA. I understand that your measure could be interesting for students who focus on the quality of their learning experience but many of those people are already using the S/U option. The system you are suggesting would promote using the S/U option as a freebie GPA boosting guaranteed resource by people who are already looking to take advantage of the system (the weak GPA consistency across departments at mcgill).

These people abusing the proposed S/U option to improve their GPA would then be at an advantage compared to their peers who would not be doing the same, which would encourage other students competing for high GPA opportunities like NSERC to adopt the same behavior.

I understand that we are talking about relatively low inflation here, but it's a relatively low-impact measure you are suggesting, so if most of the impact of such a measure is negative I simply don't understand how it can be deemed a reasonable idea. It honestly is a bit scary to me that you had not even considered this, which I was quickly summarizing because I assumed it was something that you had thought about. I hope this will have helped shed some light on how your system could be abused as a GPA boosting freebie.

I do think that allowing the grade to be shown on the transcript without counting towards the GPA would be a good ""feel-good"" measure of similar impact for people to whom it matters without being abusable for GPA purposes."
1056,9qfizt,"I'll let Jacob respond to the rest of this, but just to clarify - as a whole, the Senators are working on many more projects and initiatives than the 3 that were listed. Some of us are taking a really in-depth and proactive look at getting students a Fall Reading Break. Others have been looking into expanding the use of accessible, free, open educational resources in classes than can use them. Our Nursing Senator is working on creating a mobile STI clinic. The list goes on, and we'd be happy to discuss them all with anyone. This project is something that Jacob has been working on and that many of us support but I apologize if we ever gave the impression that 1/3 of the labour of all 13 undergraduate senators was being directed toward this one idea.

students retaking a class are understood to have an edge over students taking it for the first time, which is why we don't have retaken course grades overwriting the previous D or F. this is absolutely pay-to-play – it may not be the only outcome but it is still a possible outcome."

No. Students would not be able to ""re-take all their hypothetical U\[s\] until they get \[an\] S that can be converted to a good letter grade"". A ""U"" would still stay on a transcript. You cannot retake a non-A(or A-, B+, etc...) S. Meaning, the only way to get a good letter grade is to do well enough to earn it. Do you, honestly and genuinely think that a student getting 60s or 70s will choose to tank so that they can take advantage of this brilliant pay to play scheme whereby they get a U on their transcript so that they can maybe retake their elective so that they can magically get an A the second time around?

i don't think it's fair to start acting on projects just because they were in your campaign platforms for a few reasons (that I've already talked to /u/b_bur about in the McGill Discord server):

- given the election turnout, many of you were elected with less than 10% student support (assuming 17% turnout and winning with 51% of total votes). winning the election is not equivalent to student support for your ideas and it is dishonest to claim it as such. many candidates who run have 2000+ facebook friends and can simply drum up support through social connections without having to engage with most of the student population.

- many of you ran unopposed where there was no substantial No campaign. With no alternative, winning such an election with such a low percentage of votes from the whole student body hardly constitutes support for your ideas.

- campaign platforms evaporate after the campaigning period and there is no public record of your campaign-proposed projects. the student body has a short memory – that's why SSMU tried to bring a building fee increase several times to referendum (anyone remember \#saveourssmu?). furthermore, there is a cohort of students that have not seen your campaign platforms, but you still have to represent them. i'm talking about freshmen and transfer students that weren't even at McGill during your campaign.

Since you probably can't force voter turnout to increase, it would be acceptable to pursue projects that were present in your campaign as long as those remained in the public record and if you took the time to inform the student body of your rough plan of action and get feedback *before* you start bringing ideas to the Senate committees where their fate will be decided."

Many would be satisfied with a simple 3.95+ and no tangible educational gain from courses they took.

The question I asked was about a student registered for a course under the S/U option and, going into the final, had a grade in the 60s. If this student doesn't show up to the final, the student would get an S (a grade which would not count towards their GPA). The student could, however, show up and tank. In this option, the student would receive a U grade on their transcript and no credit for the class. They would -- maybe-- have the option to retake the course (likely not under the S/U option). I wanted to know if we were really concerned that many students would avail themselves of the second option.  "

You still did not answer the question, and-- to be honest-- I don't really feel like being patient with a dude that is writing rude stuff about me, but -- hey, I knew a ssmu position would require patience-- I'll try again:  


(1) It is not a given that students will be able to retake a class in which they received a U.   
(2) Even if they retake it, it would be a pretty huge gamble to expect that you are going to go from a U to an A.   


Which is why I asked:  
Do you really think students would prefer: (A) a U and the possibility to retake the course to an (B) S (which does not affect their GPA)? "
1072,9qfizt,"I believe if they didn't show up the would get an incomplete, not an S. But to answer your question, yes."
1073,9qfizt,"just because it's not a given doesn't mean it should be discounted for being contrary to your proposal. it's certainly an edge case, but it's an edge case your proposal makes possible."
1074,9qfizt,"You are right. It would be better for the student to go. I guess, also, to clarify, my test situation would actually have to involve someone who is already has 50ish marks in the course at the time of the exam because if they already passed then even if they got a 0 on the exam they still couldn't get a U. Sorry about that.   


Anyway, thanks for answering. I guess we disagree. Not really sure where else to go from there but would be interested to hear if more people think similarly. I'll probably bring this to SSMU legislative council, so that would give folks here ample time to communicate with their reps.  "
1075,9qfizt,"Forgive me, but it doesn't seem like you uphold the same standard that you impose on others when it comes to rigour of thought, intellectual honesty, or even just decency in terms of answering a fairly basic question. Look, I get that I'm elected and you aren't; so, if you want to use that as your reason not to answer my question then go for it! But, for all the comments about my intellect and character, I do-- perhaps naively-- believe that you (a) care about holding ssmu elected officials accountable and (b) think this S/U change is a bad idea. As such, I'm trying to engage. Whatever you wrote there, though, doesn't really give me anything to work with. "
1076,9qfizt,"I think I'm understanding your question now that I've slept.

No they would not, because there's no benefit to having just an S after taking the course a 2nd time."
1077,9qfizt,"Thanks! Somehow we still aren't communicating well, but since you tried to answer-- now that I've slept-- I'll try again too:   


Do you think, under my proposed system, that a student taking a course S/U and on track to get an S (in the C to B range) would intentionally start tanking to ensure that they get a U so that they could maybe have the option to retake the course and get an A the second time? It seems to me that this is highly improbable. It is a really big/stupid risk to take.   "
1078,9qfizt,"Yes, I think that would still happen. It would be uncommon, but still an available option for the student if they don't mind losing the 3 attempted credits the first time around. My point is that while uncommon, the door would still be open for that option, no matter how foolish it might be."
1079,9pvw5y,"I was in exactly the same situation, only without the chemistry background you claim to have. 

There will always be people that are better prepared, but don't think for a second they didn't work for it. All this means is you need to build up that experience and prepare yourself now. Review the lecture notes after the days classes and ask yourself did you understand the lecture. If not do a couple of questions from the text book. For physics you'll find that the approaches in easier problems can provide great insight and get you going on more difficult Kappa questions. Finally, prepare yourself for upcoming lectures by reading ahead in the textbook - the syllabus should be online somewhere. This is your education and you are in control of it. 

I also want to point out, there's most likely loads of people having the same issues with chemistry that I expect you are not having. Take advantage of that. Don't think about your focus on chemistry in HS as a disadvantage - it should provide you the opportunity to focus on physics and math now. 

Kappa is really as hard as it gets for 131 - when I took the class it was the basis for the midterms and finals so if you're struggling with them, that's normal. It's not your ordinary homework. Be positive - don't sulk over your comp exam - and work hard. That's the expectation and it'll help you succeed when you graduate. McGill teaches tenacity and a good work ethic better than anything else.

Finally, reach out to your TAs and Ragan for help if you need it. They are just as much resources as your textbook and the internet. They want you to learn, not to suffer."
1080,9pvw5y,"Adding on to /u/McGillMATHLUVA I would also say that the first year physics courses are inherently very tough because the math you need to fully understand the material is usually taught in advanced calculus courses (MATH 314, for example). I bet that more people than you think are in your shoes in regards to the class. 

If you have anything that is giving you a lot of trouble for the class (or for COMP 202 or MATH 133 as well) feel free to PM me and I can try to help you out.

Edit: wording "
1081,9pvw5y,"I've taken all of those classes (as have many other people), so PM if you need help. 

Also, remember a few things:

 - I know it doesn't really help you, but you're far from alone. 

 - For many first year classes, your final can replace your midterm. Obviously it's better not to rely on that, but all is not lost if you have a bad day and screw up a midterm.

 - A lot of the time, people in your shoes are just so overwhelmed that they don't know where to start. You need to get yourself out of that hole. My suggestion would be to pick up your textbook or other material for each class and go back to the last point where you understood what was going on, even if you have to go back several weeks. Start working form there. As soon as you get stuck somewhere, go ask somebody about that concept. For example, maybe you'll get stuck on determinants in 133 or centripetal acceleration in 131. It's amazing how much clearer things get when someone explains a concept that you've been confused about. You can go to your prof's office hours, but there's also FrezCa, the math help desk (Burnside 911), TAs, Khan Academy (which saved me in my first year), 3Blue1Brown for 133, and a host of other resources. If one resource feels intimidating, then choose a different one. Then keep working and stop every time you get stuck. You might be tempted to brush over something you don't understand because you're anxious or ""in a hurry"", but at the end of the day that's not going to get you anywhere. 

 - Try to write everything down on a piece of paper. Take one sheet for every course and write down every topic that's been covered, and then cross off the ones you understand (be honest). If in doubt, don't cross it off. Then go to the first topic that isn't crossed off and start there. You might want to create a (realistic) schedule, but you don't necessarily have to. Writing stuff down is just a way for you to organize your thoughts and get a handle on your situation so that, hopefully, it isn't so overwhelming that you become paralyzed by stress, if that makes sense. 

Also, for PHYS 131 specifically:

 - Ragan won't give you a test question that requires integrals.

 - CAPA questions are harder than test questions. 

 - There are past exams on docuum (if you don't know what that is, check it out), and Ragan posts past exams as well. 

 - There might be a cram session offered by EUS, so look out for that on Facebook. 

 - Khan Academy and Youtube have a lot of very similar questions to the CAPA ones, so it often helps to watch the questions and do them along with the video until you understand the general process. You can also find explanations for the exact same questions on the internet most of the time. "
1082,9pvw5y,"I also barely had any physics background, nothing like the students coming from IB or AP  seemed to.

Got a D in both of PHYS 131 and MATH 133 and am currently taking both of them again. 

I can assure that after having taken them for a year, and now having some sort of background, the concepts are significantly easier to grasp. You are in no way less intelligent than your peers, even though it really may seem that way. You were just less prepared than they were, at no fault of your own.

You'll probably fail the physics midterm. And that's okay! Lots of students do. Now you know how difficult Ragan's physics class is, and that you'll have to work harder in that class than probably any of the others you're currently taking. "
1083,9pvw5y,"I'm honestly so scared for the physics midterm, like you i have my math133 quizz 30 minutes before the midterm and the next day i have my math150 midterm so i'm really struggling with all the work right now.
But remember the midterm can count for 0% so if you fail it's ok, the final is on the 19th so if you have your other final before it'll give you the time to work on it. The math133 quizz is only worth 5% so it's not so much and if you read the book and do the exercices in it you'll probably do well. 
For physics my only strategy is to do all the exercices in the text book so that on the midterm i'll be familiar with so much type of problems that i should feel somewhat safe."
1084,9pvw5y,"You’re not alone. A lot of McGill students have struggled through those courses. One bad midterm and one bad quiz will suck now but it it’s not the end of the world. What you really have to do is get some help and catch up before your too overwhelmed. I suggest finding a TEAM member or a TA you like (not too much hehe) and taking some time to walk through the material with them. Or better yet, make friends with someone who is succeeding in the course and is willing to help you with CAPA/Studying, a lot of students hone their skills when they teach it to someone else so it is good for them too! Working with others always makes me feel so much less alone so I highly recommend it! Keep working at it and you will get it, don’t give up!"
1085,9pvw5y,"Dude I feel you about being in a hole during midterms. Last winter, when I was a U0, I got strep during all my midterms (mid to late February) and spent 10 days in bed. After recovering, I wound up doing piss poor on most of my midterms (almost failed one). It took a total drain on me mentally as well. 

My advice is to just move on and try to focus on the future. After a bad exam, there is literally nothing you can do to change the outcome. First thing is go to your prof and TA's office hours as often as possible. Hell, go every week if you need to. The second thing is figure out how you can change your study habits so that you retain information and understand it better. 

As for the mental health piece, don't let yourself sink further there. If you need to find someone to talk to, do that. Feel free to hit my inbox if you really need to talk to someone. Finally, I'd encourage you to exercise at least every weekday, it'll help clear your mind and keep you motivated. Anyways, good luck with everything and I hope your midterm goes well!"
1086,9pvw5y,"Thanks for the warm and helpful responses everyone. To be honest, I created this thread mainly for the reassurance that I wasn't the only one who was struggling. 

I have a small circle of friends who know the physics content much better than I do, so I eventually developed an inferiority complex and am still struggling to deal with it when around them. 

I already had a plan in mind; I would start attending MATH 133 and FrezCa tutorials and doing extra problems online or out of the textbook. The only problem was that I felt so much dread that my mental state just snapped. "
1087,9pvw5y,"There is no worse physics department than our at Concordia. Idk about McGill bit id love to see people take our exams. They are legit hell. To the point people refuse to sign up to fill classes because the failing rate is so high. Im a biochemist but math has always been my love and strength among many courses. I had some trouble though with physics at first because its a lot of material. Coming from someone who has a mental disorder and who has failed before a lot because of panic attacks and a host of other things way worse than regular stress ill give you my advice. 

1) Do your best and dont burden yourself if you cannot handle it. Take less courses and do well in them is better than more and you do bad in all or mediocre.

2) I read textbooks in the full and do suggested problems. If i see a teacher hasnt given problems i always ask them for it. There are videos, lectures, notes and you name it free online. Use these recources. Not everyone can do well with half ass lecture notes. I take intense lecture notes when i attend class but i never study them because i cant stand broken trains of thought. Textbook gives EVERYTHING in physics.

3) Make a cheat sheet. I make a cheat sheet of every chapter formulas and review only that the day of exams.

4) Go see a guidance counselor. Ask your options if it doesn't go well.

5) Some courses have free tutoring. Research if there is for that course and go do it. Go to tutorials and stuff these are all there for you.

6) Go to gradesavers or hire a private tutor. If you study and you see it doesnt work go get tutoring at gradesavers. They do reviews of almost all the courses

lastly, do practice midterms and exams if you are short on time. If you can do those somewhat good you are at least going to be calmer in the exam than if you dont.

Take it from me, ive seen all the faces of stress my whole life. You have to think positive and whatever happens if you have health and you are going to live on no matter what dont worry too much. Stress literally kills people. I hate these modest wannabee students sometimes who say they are stressed just to say it. Truly few know true stress and im telling you school aint worth it. Dont worry too much life goes on just do your best."

1093,9pvw5y,"Knowing what an integral is or how to do one is not at all necessary to do well in that class

It just provides more of a background for people that know them. In 142 knowing integrals will be important "
1094,9pvw5y,If it’s any consolation I also didn’t learn integration until the semester after 131 and I still did relatively well. IIRC Ragan promised we wouldn’t have to integrate on the exams and I think he followed up.
1095,9pvw5y,[deleted]
1096,9pvw5y,Yep he totaly did ! So normaly we're safe. If you look at the past midterms there was never an integral so he should be ok
1097,a4rc7j,"You can retake the course and it will appear on your transcript with your new grade. The new mark just won't count towards your GPA or credit total, and of course your first attempt will also remain on your transcript. 

Hundemer is a pretty easy grader, so given your past performance, it might be better for you to retake that course than to risk doing poorly in a more difficult honours course. "
1098,a4rc7j,"wot.... 
thats a game changer. 
Thanks
also, Have you taken math 255, if so do you recommend it over retaking 243 given that I sort of have a basic idea of the content from 243? "
1099,a4rc7j,"I haven't taken both, so I can't really compare the two streams directly, but personally I would just retake MATH 243. 

The reason I say that is because in order to create the impression that analysis isn't a ""weak spot"" for you, you need to do disproportionally well in whichever course you decide to take. If you'd normally be shooting for a B (an ""average"" grade, I don't know what your actual average is), then you need at least an A- in whichever course you take, especially since you'd be familiar with the material either way. Getting a B on your second attempt wouldn't exactly help you. 

I know that, with the honours course, your mark could maybe afford to be a bit lower because it's harder, but it's still a second attempt in that you're going in having seen the material before. As such, it still needs to be higher than your ""average"" performance, so the lowest you could afford is maybe a B+. 

Between an A- in MATH 243 and a B+ in MATH 255, I would definitely say that it's easier to do 5% better in a non-honours course. 

Also consider the risk you're taking. Your chances of doing better in MATH 243 are pretty good. If, however, you take MATH 255 and don't do well (it's not inconceivable that you might do equally well or only slightly better), then you not only have a low grade in that course, which even on its own wouldn't be ideal for someone headed for grad school, but that grade would also effectively act as confirmation that the MATH 243 mark wasn't a fluke, and that it's actually a weak spot rather than a single bad grade. You will have established a trend. 

The benefits of taking MATH 255 are:

 - If, hypothetically, you could do equally well in both courses, the honours level course would look better.

 - 3 credits and a small boost to your CGPA

The credits/GPA are negligible, especially if you're already in your third or fourth year, so the ""honours"" descriptor and a slightly higher tolerance for a lower grade it the only benefit. Given that you say you worked your ass off and got a B in the last honours course you took, and that your got a low grade in the non-honours equivalent, I honestly think it's too big a risk to take the honours course given the type of performance you need to demonstrate. 

You could also do none of the above and take Analysis 3. It would be new material, so having seen it before wouldn't be held against you, it's not honours, so you have a better idea of what to expect, and it's just as good a way, if not a better way, to demonstrate that the Analysis 2 grade was a fluke, especially if you did pretty well in Analysis 1 and are pretty good at math courses in general. 

TL;DR: I think it would be better to retake MATH 243, if you're confident you can pull off a an ""above-average"" grade, or to take Analysis 3, if you think you can get an ""average"" grade. "
1100,a4rc7j,"Ya that makes sense. Im not really chasing the GPA boost, its mostly about me showing to grad schools that I understand basic analysis. Im pretty confident that if I retook 243 I would get at least an A-, whereas if I took 255 I would probably at most get a B+ and thats if I study like a mad man which i am not sure will be feasible given my other classes are pretty demanding. 

Thanks for the advice!"
1101,a4rc7j,"If you retake 243 and do well, you can also do Analysis 3 on top of that if you want. Doing well in both sends a pretty strong message. "

1106,a7hfgh,When you cant choose the right answer eliminate the wrong ones. Work the goddamn probabilities. Eliminated 2/4 choices. You now have a 50% chance at guessing the right answer. Thats already a plus.
1107,a7hfgh,"2/5 for most STEM courses. But you can usually eliminate 3 if you understand the concept, 2 if you have a weaker but still general understanding. Eliminate what you can and do the rest, then keep looping through your test and attempting the question again. Once of three things eventually happens: 

a) Sometimes your brain just needs a few shots in order to get the ball into the basket, and all of a sudden the answer is completely obvious (sometimes after reading it 5+ times). 

b) You end up stuck between two answers, debating a single detail that you're not sure about, and the inventor of the multiple choice exam rests happily in his grave as you resign yourself to the 50/50 odds you're left with. 

c) If you can't narrow it down to two, you're probably just confused about the concept in general and didn't study it well enough, so you make an educated guess. 

But yeah, don't just do the question once, pick an answer, and be done with it. Come at it over and over again. It caters to how your brain works, makes associations, and recalls information. "

1122,bdl4cw,At UofT two people killed themselves since January and at Concordia a girl also killed herself earlier this year. All of these suicides were done at their University. Heck we are barely entering April
1123,bdl4cw,How horrible! Have the schools announced changes to be made in regards of this? Do you think it's because of the coursework? Or just because of some mental illness and not related to the uni?
1124,879vwc,"First things first, it sucks to hear that's happening to her, no one deserves to go through that, I hope she knows she's not alone and that she has people that'll fight for her. 

My first thought would be to go to the McGill Legal Information Clinic, they have a section specifically dedicated to student complaints and they would have the resources to help you if that's the path you want to go down. As well, the Office of the Dean of Students would be particularly helpful as they focus on student well-being and would also be able to point you in the right direction. 

Hope this helps!"
1125,879vwc,"Don't know if this will lead to anything for OP but think I figured who is the Resident involved, student showed me this thread. It is probably one of the worst cases I have seen within our program (I'm staff). Resident is a gem. I know Resident has tried to escalate the issue within the faculty to no avail in past. It has exposed a very ugly side of life here, hope she finds help.    "
1126,879vwc,"Might sound stupid (or perhaps you've already done that), but reach out to her? Sometime these people are more in need of a friend than justice, just somebody that can be there for her. I assume she must be/feel isolated if people stood aside for fear of taking sides"
1127,879vwc,Sorry to hear about your freind's plight. I was advised by a McGill staffer to point her to the WELL office. Hope it helps... http://www.mcgill.ca/thewelloffice/learning-environment/report-mistreatment
1128,879vwc,"Good for you for sticking up for a beleaguered colleague, I hope that she's able to get some support with your help"
1129,879vwc,"This is really cool that you're trying to help. You're not just conscious, you're a good bagel!"
1130,879vwc,"Perhaps she can get support from the FMRQ? (I'm in Ontario but assume this is your counterpart to PARO)

1131,879vwc,"Define ''severe bullying''. There are 7 billion humans on this planet. Life's too short to ''deal'' with bullies. Just sue them for harassment. If you're a shithead in 2018, you've got to go. "
1132,879vwc,"to you, /u/IamaConsciousBagel, and /u/avocado-queen:

be careful about suggesting the dean of students in this case, because at the end of the day, they are a university employee too. the university could very well decide to protect its reputation over the student in question. the legal information clinic (or any other party independent of mcgill) is probably a better bet.

also, a reminder that one-party recording is legal in canada - you can record conversations if one party in the communication consents. the person recording can be the resident in question, if they are party to the conversation or if it is directed at them."
1133,879vwc,"How has the staff allowed for the situation to escalate to this degree? Not pointing the finger at you, just wondering why staff physicians/supervisors are aware of this ongoing issue with one of their residents and haven't tried to mediate the situation...

To OP, this definitely sounds like an issue that could (hopefully) be sorted out by the Office of the Dean of Students, as another user has suggested. Good luck to your fellow resident! "
1134,879vwc,One example : An email was sent to the entire faculty from an anonymous address mocking her and saying she suffers from severe mental illness.

1136,879vwc,"As a followup: the resident should document everything - emails should 
be saved by forwarding to an account independent of mcgill, all 
interactions should be recorded and/or memos should be written 
immediately after the interaction occurs, etc. Hearsay from others 
should also be documented as soon as it is received. 

Any office or individual connected with the university should be 
approached with caution, for reasons stated above. Confiding in them 
could invalidate any further action that may have to be taken."
1137,879vwc,"I don't know all details of story, but heard it was allegedly mishandled by program director. Staff here afraid to talk for fear of being involved in litigation by student or uni."
1138,879vwc,"can confirm email, saw it. Goes back a year or so."
1139,879vwc,I'd 100% press charges and have police trace that e-mail to the exact IP address. Bullies need to be exposed and destroyed.
1140,879vwc,"Wow, amazing advice thank you"
1141,879vwc,That’s not possible . They won’t track IP for something like that. Since no one is in danger and technically no law was broken . 
1142,879vwc,Um leave the legal advice to actual lawyers. 
1143,879vwc,i'm not a lawyer but i hope this helps :)
1144,879vwc,Laws were definitely broken. You can't go around spreading false rumors to damage someone's professionally. Damaging someone professionally is basically attempted murder. If that person's career is done = homeless = death. 
1145,879vwc,[deleted]
1146,879vwc,How about I shit down your throat instead? You better chew it all.
1147,879vwc,You would have to show damages . Ie if she were to be kicked out of the program because of it then she could sue . You also do not know what is true and what is not . 
1148,879vwc,"So you're suggesting that the resident breaks the law in accessing 
sensitive information, without going through the appropriate channels? 
This is pretty misinformed on how data requests from law enforcement 
work, not to mention that mcgill emails are through microsoft office, 
which are probably impossible even for a ""tech-savy [sic] friend"" to 
crack. This comment reeks of misinformation and provides poor advice 
rather dangerously, so you should think a bit more before commenting."
1149,879vwc,I mean I don’t really get what OP or anyone Intends to do with the IP tracking . It seems they already know who the bully are 
1150,879vwc,Still. Damaging her reputation.
1151,879vwc,"yeah you're right, pretty stupid advice! *deleted*"
1152,879vwc,"True! But otherwise, why tf do graduate students act like they were insecure 12yo kids? "
1153,879vwc,"That is not illegal though . However , I am sure what the other students have allegedly done is against the conduct rules of McGill. Hence they could likely be kicked out via that process , but unlikely ."
1154,879vwc,shit u were reasonable even after i called u out - you're one of the good ones :)

1229,b4f968,My friend suggested me this clinic a while back that covers 80% of your cost with Mcgill bluecross insurance. It’s montrealtherapy.com ! 
1230,b4f968,"I got seen by a McGill psychiatrist faster (I think I waited about two weeks?), but iirc that was only because my referral said I was a suicide risk & potentially had some kind of cognitive impairment."
1231,b4f968,"You can get psychiatric drugs prescribed to you at a walk in clinic, and then ask them to refer you to an actual psychiatrist to follow up. This works for me though because I've been on the same kind of drugs for years, if you're completely new it might not be such a good idea. 

Make sure the walk in you go to is public, weirdly there are a lot of private clinics in montreal and you'll have to pay "
1232,b4f968,It's unlikely you will see a psychiatrist elsewhere any faster unless it's a crisis and you go through the emergency department at the JGH or Douglas. It is possible I guess that there is a private psychiatrist somewhere who could see you faster but I'm not familiar with any myself. It's just a long wait for psychiatric care unfortunately.
1233,b4f968,"While you are waiting, see a doctor. They can rule out any underlying physical medical issue. 

Édit: forgot the word physical "
1234,b4f968,"I don't think you will get to see a psychiatrist super fast. If it is that urgent, you should go to the ER."
1235,b4f968,"I went to psychiatric services at mcgill completely deranged on the 5th floor of the brown building (elevators by normal health center). I got an appointment the same day. They have appointments designated for emergency’s everyday 11-1pm. After my emergency appointment I saw a physiatrist biweekly for months at mcgill psychiatric services! I had the greatest experience but you have to be persistent and not leave easily.  You must go to the office for them to schedule it, they will not offer this over the phone. "
1236,b4f968,"This is a good place for therapy but I'm not certain they have psychiatrists. I think it's mostly psychologists. 

"
1237,b4f968,"yeah, i was also seen by the mcgill psychiatrist very early (one week wait time after hospital visit) - i was only able get that appointment because montreal general was concerned i was a danger to myself and called on my behalf to make sure i got an appointment."
1238,b4f968,"I was just about to comment this, good thing I scrolled down!

For a walk-in I recommend Herzl clinic (who also have a free therapy program for teens & young adults they could refer you too if you are young enough) or Startcare emergency clinic, but that one is in Pointe-Claire."
1239,b4f968,thank u so much!! as someone suggested above i went to mtlgeneral for an emergency appointment and they said they’d expedite my appointment with mcgill psychiatric services. they were supposed to get back to me yesterday but they still haven’t so i think the next thing has to be demanding this at the brown building lol 
1240,b4f968,you met with a doctor first and they managed to get an appointment? 
1241,b4f968,"not sure if you're asking me or the parent commenter, but this is how it happened in my situation:

tldr : yes. a montreal general psychiatrist saw me and after evaluating my condition, he thankfully gets me an appointment with the psychiatrist at mcgill mental health (one-week wait time).

went to mcgill clinic first, got the same ""three month wait time"" speech.

visited a gp off-campus at the union md clinic out of desperation. got diagnosed with major depressive disorder, prescription for zoloft. paid 250 out of pocket. gave me a referral to a psychotherapist (didn't get a chance to use, see below).

had a mental breakdown. crying, was convinced face was peeling off, pupils were dilated to an abnormal extent, shortness of breath, etc, etc. it was really, really bad (simply put). dad, out of concern for me, called the mcgill mental health clinic and forces the doctors to see me (symptoms were seemingly more medical/physical than psychological which is why the appt was with the doctors and not the psychiatrist). i exhibited some alarming symptoms while there. doctors at mcgill mental health clinic sent me to the hospital in an ambulance. 


did overnight at hospital b/c sugar was at 17 + and that's not normal. stablised after an hour but was kept for observation. hospital psychiatrist visits me the following morning and evaluates me - makes a call and gets me an appt with the mcgill psychiatrist. i just saw him this past wednesday. i have weekly sessions with him now.



"
1242,b4f968,"They will sometimes fast-track you if they think that there is an immediate threat (such as high suicide risk, more serious cases of drug addiction, mental episode that lands you in the hospital, losing touch with reality, etc.). That's how some people get seen more quickly. Unfortunately, the wait times are significant, but I would definitely encourage you to phone up Blue Cross to find out which clinics they cover - it's not like that can slow down the process. "
1243,b4f968,"i was asking about you! so you had an emergency situation.

on the surface for me it doesn’t appear to be an extreme situation but i know how impulsive i can be and I’m genuinely scared for myself - my anxiety got so bad to the point that even approaching the subject with my therapist took 6 sessions. and for the last week it’s been interfering with a lot in that i keep having anxiety attacks and i’ve barely been sleeping, didn’t go to any classes and I’m just completely fucked mentally. this is why i want to see a psychiatrist right now, I’m afraid the longer i wait the worse it’s going to get, and my sister has expressed (jokingly but i think just to not seem too harsh) that she can be afraid of me and i wasn’t realising.

also the physical manifestations have been so much worse this week i don’t know how to deal with it immediately but i really need to 


would you recommend just walking in to the clinic to see the whatever the fastest possible solution is? 

was the clinic covered by insurance i don’t have 250 out of pocket which is also stressful since i know the clinics require payment upfront "
1244,b4f968,"yeah, for me it started by not going to classes - then it progressed to skin obsession (standing in front of the mirror for hours), crying, self-hate, being unable to work and focus on anything but my skin, poor marks, believing i'm too ugly to go outside, etc. not eating then eating too much. don't let it progress!

i would. walking into the clinic and asking for possible solutions can't hurt! i know the clinic itself has walk-in appts. make sure to get there early if you're planning on getting one, like *really* early. tell them you're paying all this money for mcgill health insurance and yet you're unable to access the services (i.e. psychiatry) that you need. tell them that you don't want to wait until your situation worsens to the point where you don't know how to deal with it anymore. don't hold back : be completely honest about what you are going through.

you can try seeing someone off-campus (like i did) with knowledge of the mcgill health clinic and their practices and have them evaluate you - you can ask them to make a call and book an appt with the psychiatry services on your behalf. paying for these services out of pocket is difficult though and i don't know how many clinics outside of mcgill are covered by blue cross/able to get an appt like montreal general did.

it sounds like you're going through a lot. i know how that feels and it's hard - i wish the best for you <3
"
1245,b4f968,"thank u so much for all your help and feedback!! i’ll definitely look into this and hopefully can see someone by tomorrow morning. 

Also i don’t know how logical this would be but i get too anxious to fully explain what I’m feeling or like i don’t let on the extent of it. is it possible for me to write down and show whoever i see bc it’s a lot more convenient that way "
1246,aqczrd,Probably would be easier to make a map of where I didn't cry 
1247,aqczrd,I'm proud^? to say I have cried on 5 different floors of Burnside Hall!
1248,aqczrd,Back in Brazil we had a map for places people got robbed near the campus. True story.
1249,aqczrd,You'll expose people's secret crying spots!!
1250,aqczrd,Please post results when you close the survey
1251,aqczrd,A part of me is reluctant to fill this out because I want to gatekeep my favourite crying spots
1252,aqczrd,Uh oh here comes the positivity brigade 
1253,aqczrd,[deleted]
1254,aqczrd,management not a faculty option?
1255,aqczrd,oh man that form would take 2 days for me to complete
1256,aqczrd,"Why not also have a map where people have laughed? Where people have fallen in love? Where people have found hope? Where any number of other emotional experiences could be represented? This is a bizarre mindset, to say the least. "
1257,aqczrd,It's okay to acknowledge that people get overwhelmed or sad or upset and cry
1258,aqczrd,"We're trying to get as large a volume of responses as possible to make an interactive map that would then be made publicly available to everyone. It's not just for fun, we'd like to make it clear how common crying on campus is and allow people to read and share their experiences in a visually informative way. "
1259,aqczrd,Why not ?
1260,aqczrd,snakes can't shed tears
1261,aqczrd,no
1262,aqczrd,"Management is an option now, sorry about that!"
1263,aqczrd,"Laughing is a pretty common occurrence and it would be near impossible to pinpoint ""where"" you laughed on campus. Falling in love is something that usually happens over time. Crying is much easier to locate, since the physical manifestations are clear, and it seldom happens. It's also a good way to make people aware of mental health problems on campus, while reassuring those who are stressed out/anxious/sad that they are not alone. "
1264,aqczrd,Is this for GEOG 384?
1265,aqczrd,"But why?

What are you trying to accomplish with this?"
1266,aqczrd,"That is sort of my point...are you not blowing up something that is rare and making more of a bigger deal than it is, when perhaps you should be focusing your energies on the vast more representative moments of joy and bliss on campus? And crying is just crying. It is not a ""mental health"" issue, but just a normal physical response to an emotion. I think the term ""mental health"" is so over used and misapplied that just a normal human moment is called a ""mental health"" issues/crisis etc etc etc. I just think this sort of project misrepresents the reality and feeds into a negative loop which effectively confirms the bias. No one who looks at your weeping map of McGill will see that it ""Seldom happens"" as you say, but will think, OH DEAR GOD what a horrible, abusive place, which is certainly not the case as ""laughing is a pretty common occurrence and it would be near impossible to pinpoint where you laughed""...that is because the whole campus would look like one big smile. And again, one ought not to pathologize tears. It is totally normal, and it shows a normal emotional state of being. "
1267,aqczrd,"Well I think it is a great way to show people that it is okay to cry and people do it more than you think. It is very common for students to think that they are failures and everyone else is doing amazingly. However, in reality, that is not true and the “secret” aspect of the map, I think, is a great way to further convince others. Great job OP, this is a perfect idea. "
1268,aqczrd,Probably to emphasize to people that they're not the only ones with those experiences. Shining a spotlight on something that is very private and people often don't talk about or admit openly can be an effective way to make such a point. 
1269,aqczrd,"Sounds like a nice assumption, but would like to hear what the OP has planned for this."
1270,aqczrd,I think /u/Spoonydoo summed it up perfectly. 
1271,8yoytm,"Yeah unfortunately a background in Biology does not really help you with bioinformatics. I am currently finishing my masters at McGill in computational biology (in CS) after an undergrad in CS & Bio and tbh I have not once used something I learned in biology in my research so far, and constantly find myself wishing I had done more math. 
For the masters in CS, McGill requires you to have completed the equivalent of at least a minor in CS, and you need a decent GPA and decent letters of recommendation preferably from academia, so if your GPA is poor and you don't have research experience this looks like a dead end without a second degree.

You could do your second bachelors in CS from Arts, which is just as good as CS in Science and should be easier to get admitted to."
1272,8yoytm,"You can do a BA in CS at McGill. It's basically the exact same if you take the supplementary CS minor. You don't need any prereqs for the BA.

Grades are still an issue though. Even for a BA, second degree applicants need high GPAs. Depends on the year but below a 3.5 probably means no dice. 

You definitely couldn't do a joint major in Bio and CS at McGill anyway. Your previous BSc bio would preclude you from too many courses. It also doesn't make sense. You would just get a BSc Bio + BSc/BA CS in the end so why make the second a joint degree?

McGill requires you to take 60 credits in order to get a degree. If you have a degree already, that means taking just 2 years of courses. You obviously still need to complete the program requirements but a CS degree would be 60 credits anyway so that means a perfectly succinct 2 years. 

Other schools probably have similar regulations but you would need to get recognition for your transfer credits. (As in, the degree is still 120 credits, but at McGill they would just take your past degree as 60 credits of complementaries and that would just leave the 60 required credits from the program).

Bootcamps aren't really given much credit in most domains. They can help you to become a code monkey but that's about it. You can learn CS theory on your own but it will be harder to get a foot in the door to something interesting.

I see two reasonable options (there are probably more, this is just my POV). You could take a second CS degree at another school if McGill's entrance requirements are too steep (GPA is king and they don't make concessions). Hopefully you could get enough transfer credits to complete the program in 2 years as you would at McGill. Alternatively, you could register as an independent student and take a few CS courses per semester. Most CS-related masters programs require an approximation of a CS minor (around 8 courses in CS). Every school has its own restrictions. I believe McGill requires specific CS courses whereas UofT just wants a ""strong minor in CS"" or some-such. There are probably restrictions and limitations I'm not aware of, but this is definitely a potential avenue.

Edit: I should add that many universities do **not** see a bootcamp as equivalent to university coursework. For a masters program, it would probably be a waste of time."
1273,8yoytm,"Hey, if you want to look into a Comp2-- level class related to Biology, I suggest you to take or check Comp204 computer programming for life sciences. I have a buddy who has taken it and is now working with a prof doing bioinformatics research. Maybe that could be a start. As for bootcamps, according to the little things I know about them... I would stay away from them since your goal is more research oriented/theoretical and bootcamps tend to be a lot more practical.

Hopefully, what you could do is to take comp204 and learn other CS class over the internet, like mit opencourseware, stanford CS class or even EdX. Online resources for CS are plenty and sufficient for you to become really good. With some research and asking around, you could tailor your own bio oriented CS education. What is hard is to motivate yourself to do them. So i dont know if it s the best idea."
1274,8yoytm,"COMP 204 is more designed for people who don't plan on doing further CS. If someone is planning on doing a CS degree or taking an equivalent to COMP 250, 202 is just a better course to take.

204 is a nice general interest course but it does not really teach you the formalism that you will need in further courses.
"
1275,8fhdfn,"I actually had a very similar situation last winter: my bipolar wasn't newly diagnosed but it was newly medicated. One of my meds was being overprescribed, and I got launched into a depressive episode on top of having gotten a concussion right before exams. I failed two exams for classes that should've been easy As for me. When I spoke to the professors about it, they told me there was nothing they could do because I passed the courses. I didn't escalate it to the dean because I mean....I was not doing well and a pass was good enough for me at that point, so I can't say if that would have helped. One of the profs was tremendously understanding though and reorganized my grade a bit, dropping weight from a midterm I wrote literally right after leaving the psych ward that I didn't actually think defer, etc.

I'm sure this isn't really what you want to hear, but keep in mind one (or two) bad grades isn't everything. I went from high 3s to low-mid 3s after that semester, and immediately boosted myself back up during the summer semester. I was accepted to my inter-faculty transfers last summer (granted I did have to suck it up and explain my situation in the lil box about extenuating circumstances) and even a ""prestigious"" research position this summer. Obviously I don't know your exact situation, but one bad semester (even for me when mine was half my GPA at that point) almost certainly won't ruin your chances of doing whatever it is you want to do. 

Edit: if you're concerned about the dean or whoever else understanding the validity of bipolar, feel free to message me to talk about it; I've had the lovely experience of convincing more middle aged men in academia that Yes My Brain Really Works Like This Thanks than I ever would have wanted to."
1276,8fhdfn,[deleted]
1277,8fhdfn,"Once it's written, it's over. Can't change anything."
1278,8fhdfn,"Don’t listen to the bloke who says that you are fucked. I’ve seen close friends go through this kind of cycle/situation with varying degrees of outcomes. If you have a 3.9 gpa going in, everyone is very understanding and will help you get through (maybe not with an A) but ive also seen students with bad gpa’s get turned down because they simply look ill prepared. 

Emphasize your strong prior history and if there is an administrative avenue, the staff and faculty will help you to the maximum extent."
1279,8fhdfn,">bubbled in answers that ""looked nice"" for my MC

Just watch you get that 4.0 tbh"
1280,8fhdfn,"Apply for an Eflag to the dean of your faculty to get your grades erased
You need a letter from your therapist and one from you explaining your situation"
1281,8fhdfn,"Omg I hope things end up ok for you, I can't imagine going through this kind of shit. :(
I don't know much about appealing to the faculty dean but it's worth a shot. But even if they can't change anything, know that one or two bad grades won't completely derail your life (even though it might feel that way especially since you seem like a high achiever). Yes, it might mean the difference between getting into a particular program or not, but don't think that all hope is lost. There will always be something that you can do. The most important thing is your health right now. Bipolar is no joke, people lose their lives to mental illness every day. I hope you recover from this and that it won't impact your academics too much. "
1282,8fhdfn,"I know that one or two bad grades won't matter in the long run, my problem is that I need a high GPA for just one last semester in order to get into the program I want. After that it can tank if it wants to. ;)

The exam was worth most of my grade, so I don't think there's much the professor could go on, and for the other exam, while I didn't get an A, I did more or less OK, so I think I'll just leave it be. "
1283,8fhdfn,"I hope you're wrong, but I think you might be right. 

I hate that they made me finish the exam and now they're probably going to be like ""sorry, you finished, so you're screwed"". "
1284,8fhdfn,"I will definitely do that. I've never gotten below a B+, which itself was a one time thing, so hopefully that will help me. I wish I hadn't opted for the higher final weighting instead of the midterm/final split, because that would be such a strong piece of evidence right now. "
1285,7rride,"Hey, I'm in a similar situation. Everyone is different and not everyone can be healed the same way, but I'll tell you what's worked for me.
 
-Try to be alone as little as possible. For me I found that my sadness and bad thoughts got the worst whenever I was alone. Whenever you find yourself sitting at home alone and feel sad or lonely, you should get out of the house and go to a cafe or something and just chill there. It's just nice to be around others and it can make you feel less lonely.

-Take a lighter courseload this semester. If you've been taking 5 classes, drop down to 4, maybe take a bird course. You should go easy on yourself this semester and hopefully raise your confidence. Which will make all the difference in the world. Side note: I don't know what you want to do in life, but I'm in the comp sci field and have never been asked my GPA by employers.

-Think about reaching out to some acquaintances from Rez who you could see a friendship with. Just a quick facebook message like ""Johnny! How have you been man?"" 

-Join a club. Reach out to the CSUS to meet people in your program; maybe even join a fraternity/sorority if that's what you're into. These are all really great ways to get involved on campus, meet people and make friendships that will stick, make the McGill community feel smaller and less overwhelming, etc. 

Good luck, I really hope things will get better. Don't hesitate to PM me if you want to talk. 

Edit: I forgot to address your original question. No, you shouldn't drop out. There's still time to raise your GPA and turn your life around. A lot of 4th years say that 2nd year was the worst for them and then things got much better. "
1286,7rride,"I graduated a year ago, but most of my years at McGill were hell for the same reason. My best suggestion is to reduce your course load, make sure to take 1 or 2 summer classes (take one in June, another in August...) if you want to graduate within a reasonable amount of time, and please please please seek therapy if you get random suicidal thoughts. One of my friends had a tough time at McGill as well, then she transferred to Concordia and finished her compsci degree. She’s currently happy and working in the field. I’m headed to grad school this year. 

All of that to say there’s a way out of this hell hole. Slow down, seek help, change if you need to. Feel free to message me if you need to talk (but seriously).

"
1287,7rride,"Sorry to be blunt but if you are really having these serious mental health issues seek actual help with better qualified people with whom you can share more information. Dropping out is a serious decision some randos on the internet can't answer for you. There are many resources on and off campus. It's scary but it's a necessary first step, it's really hard to deal with this properly on your own.

If it's more you're feeling lonely and bummed out from less than optimal semesters: Hang in there, try to make friends like others mentioned.. in my opinion find people to work out regularly (3x/week) with. Working out makes you want to eat and sleep and you need all three to feel healthy. Unless you also have two part time jobs you have time."
1288,7rride,What faculty are you in now? 
1289,7rride,"thanks for the msg!
The cafe idea sounds like a good plan, I just hate seeing how everyone having their shit together outside and on social media (I know i should just stop looking at that stuff)

I wish I could just forget about the past..."
1290,7rride,im in Kin so education 
1291,7rride,Social media is toxic because it shows people at their best. There are tons of poeple having issues in life. You are definitely not alone.
1292,7rride,"I assure you, no one fully has their shit together. And your past is no indication of your future. You're just setting yourself up for an awesome comeback story :) "
1293,7rride,Unfollow everything on Facebook and I'd recommend not using instagram. 
1294,7rride,"To add on to that post (I'm just coming out of the phase that you're describing):


 - Pick something and pursue it, no matter what it is. Often you start to pull away from other activities in your life when you're going through a stressful time (or at least I do). It's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy because you feel like your life sucks and you're going nowhere, and as a result you get depressed and you *do* stop making progress. 

Try to pick something low/medium-risk i.e. something that you know you can reasonably accomplish (but still need to put effort into) rather than something far fetched. It can be anything from improving your Rubik's Cube solving skills to getting an A in a particular course to spending time on your artwork, but it should have an **end goal** rather than being a continuous pursuit. That will stop the cycle of feeling ""stuck"" and will make you feel like you're going somewhere and are capable of moving forward. 

If you're the type of person who likes to do this, get one of those big desk calendars and have daily goals and plan ahead by a month or two. For example, you can write down a section in your textbook to do every second day (it doesn't have to be academic though). You'll feel like you're constantly accomplishing things, even get ""ahead"", and you can visually see it and physically cross things off as you do them. 


 - Take four courses, or less if being a part-time student won't affect you in any way, and pick courses that are relatively easy, but also interesting. Calculate your TGPA from last semester and just try to beat that. Don't expect straight-As - pick a realistic goal. So, for example, if your TGPA was 2.0 last semester (about a C in each course), maybe aim for a B average and at least a C+ in each course. You can always adjust your goals if they're too easy/hard. 


 - Psychologically, and I didn't realize this until after the fact, but just being around *life forms* helps. If you don't feel like socializing, do anything else that will trick your brain into thinking that you are. I, for example, love going to Tim Hortons to study. Just being in an environment with people will keep you from shutting yourself out. Alternatively, if you don't want to leave home, just have the TV or the radio on in the background, go see those therapy dogs when they come to class, or even buy a freaking houseplant and take care of it.  


 - Talk to somebody. I know a lot of people give the advice of ""talking to a friend"" (and definitely do that if it works for you), but I personally didn't really have any close friends at the time and the thought of ""opening up"" to someone I didn't really know that well didn't appeal. 

I found it most helpful to talk to either a) someone anonymous or b) someone I was never going to see again. The internet is great for this. You can find entire subs dedicated to depression, mourning, academic stress, etc. If you're more of a 1-on-1 type of person, you can PM me  (I don't associate my account with my real identity) and discuss whatever's on your mind at the given time.  You could also use services such as the Nightline, which is also anonymous, if you're comfortable talking over the phone.

If you feel as though telling someone what your goals are will make them more concrete in your mind, then do that too. 


 - Do therapy of whatever sort you're comfortable with. Counselling is the route that people will recommend to you most often, and if that's something you'd be willing to try out i would recommend it. I tried that, but the first counsellor I saw was... well, she sucked at her job, so I didn't pursue it further, but I tried it again a year later, and the second time I had a much better experience. They can also tell you whether they think pursuing medication is a good idea in your case and give you professional advice on things that other people, although well intended, might not be qualified to speak on. 

If you don't want to do that right now, then keep it as an option for later, or if you're not sure, then go once and see how it goes. You're not obligated to show up a second time if you don't want to. 


 - Try not to get into any bad habits that will make your situation *worse*. I made that mistake myself, and it **really** crept up on me fast because I've always been more on the goodie-two-shoes side and I never thought I would react the way I did, and I really didn't recognize myself or feel like I knew who I was after the fact. I had abandoned some previously healthy relationship in my life, given up goals, and done some... questionably smart things that I won't detail on a public forum. In retrospect, I would have tried to avoid this, hence my suggestion to you. 

If you notice yourself eating junk food all the time, getting into drugs, becoming risk-prone, or whatever it may be, try to pick activities that aren't going to hurt you in the long run. For example, activities that give you an adrenaline rush flood your brain with a ""happy hormone"" and make you feel euphoric, so if you're out looking for that, then ride a roller coaster, go skydiving, or do whatever the hell it is you need to do, but try your hardest to avoid things that you know you'll end up kicking yourself for. 


I can't think of anything else right now (I'm trying to go back in my mind and remember some of the things that I struggled with), but if I do think of something that I missed I'll edit. If you think I missed something, you can reply and I'll address it if I can. 

Oh and to actually answer the **question in the title**: don't drop out right away, see how it goes with an easier workload and withdraw late if you really need to. **Trust your gut** over anything that anyone else says to you. Either way, take some time to recover over the summer. I went travelling for three months, so if you think that might get you out of your slump... "
1295,7rride,"I know nothing about your situation, but maybe it's worth talking to someone in the OSD or McGill Mental Health, or even just service point about whether you can take a semester off to try to get your mind back in the right place? 

Now would be the time to do it, before add-drop is over. "
1296,7rride,"seriously tho, I'm going to post that I got a job at facebook (hypothetical lul, I wish), but I'm never going to announce that I failed classes and shiz (less hypothetical than I would like)"
1297,7rride,yea I know that but at least their lives are somewhat stable :/ yea one day if I do something cool and people care this'll be a cool story to tell haha
1298,7rride,"The best thing anyone can learn is that really, truly, no one has their shit together. Sometimes taking a social media break can be really good for getting that toxic shit out of your system. Good luck <3"
1299,7rride,How the hell does one indent paragraphs on Reddit?
1300,7rride,"> The internet is great for this. You can find entire subs dedicated to depression, mourning, academic stress, etc.

I agree with most of what you said, but I think this is something to be cautious about. 

This is a short-term solution in my opinion, and really only good if you're like on the verge of suicide/selfharm (including drugs/alcohol) and the only thing that will keep you from it is ranting to strangers. Otherwise, you're probably gonna end up in endless co-rumination which will only strengthen negative feelings. I especially do not recommend going to such places to read other people's rants. While it can feel good to have your feelings validated in the short-term, in the long-term, it might validate them so much that you forget that it should not be normal to feel this way on a constant basis.

u/_lifesucks_ I can see you're already doing this, and I highly advise that you try to at least find another healthier mechanism to deal with this issue. Find other subs that will make you feel good instead. What kind of things do you like? Do you like animals? Find a sub that will post cute pics of animals. /r/aww is a good catch-all, but really there's a sub for almost anything out there!"
1301,7rride,yea im planning on going soon. But I cant leave because I'm receiving financial aid as well as already signed a lease for where I am so I can't drop these things unfortunately. 
1302,7rride,"yea you're right. I guess I don't want to feel alone or feel like an alien because of shitty decisions I've made. In a sense its my only community but it's bad for my thoughts because you're right I keep sitting in my bed going over these things again and again.

I'll try to change things up because you're right it validates me sitting in my bed making me feel good a little. "
1303,7rride,"> This is a short-term solution in my opinion, and really only good if you're like on the verge of suicide/selfharm (including drugs/alcohol) and the only thing that will keep you from it is ranting to strangers. 

I too agree with most of what you said, but disagree with a few things:

I don't think that online communities are only helpful if you're on the verge of suicide. They're helpful any time that you don't have anyone in your life that can relate to or is knowledgeable about what you're going through. That can be anything from learning to play piano to losing weight to travelling. 

OP mentioned that he/she doesn't really have any friends. Having been there and done that, I can personally attest that online communities were very helpful to me not only as a place to rant, but as a place to exchange ideas and opinions. 

A big part of the reason why we value friends is because we can bounce things off of them. Should I go out with so-and-so? I have a problem with another person, what should I do? Do you think I was right to do this-and-that? How do you think I could best accomplish X? 

While I am most certainly not saying that the internet can replace friendships, it can help bridge gaps and can act as a resources or direct you towards resources that can *prevent you from getting to the point where self-harm becomes a concern in the first place*. 

> Otherwise, you're probably gonna end up in endless co-rumination which will only strengthen negative feelings.

I've thought about this as well, and I agree that only spending time on those specific forums can have adverse effects when done in excess. 

However, there is a flip side, and that's all of the other communities and the environment and mentality that they endorse. There are equally many communities that focus on motivation, goal setting, improving one's mental/physical/social health, exercising, academics, you name it. 

Someone who has little outside social support would benefit greatly because ultimately, many people get depressed *because they're not accomplishing anything or moving forward*. 

OP sounds like the type of person who is in the initial stages of developing depression, and the most powerful way to combat that in my experience has been to set goals and do something that helps you move forward, or at least makes you feel as though you are. 

For example, one o my goals in the past was weight loss, and having no social support at the time, I relied heavily on an online community for both the **practical knowledge/advice** and the **motivation and mindset** I needed to get there, as well as the odd visit to self-improvement/goal-setting type communities. 

SO while I agree that just hanging around other depressed people isn't the best way to go, I do think that in moderation they can be very helpful and that in combination with other communities, the internet (reddit in particular) can go a long way towards mitigating the effects of ""low points"" in a person's life, as OP is describing. 

> u/_lifesucks_ I can see you're already doing this, and I highly advise that you try to at least find another healthier mechanism to deal with this issue.

To add on to that, in case my initial post wasn't clear, find both a variety of online communities, if you decide to do that, and try the other things I mentioned (goal setting, the calendar, counselling). In time, your gut will point you towards the combination that works best for you. 

>  /r/aww is a good catch-all,

Cute puppy pictures are actually a really great idea (which is why I suggested therapy dogs as well) because interacting with animals releases ""happy hormones"", notably oxytocin, which can make you feel happy (duh) and also relieve stress. This is true for everyone, but especially women. That's not meant to suggest that men don't have parental/nurturing instincts, but for women it's particularly strong because the release of oxytocin in response to an infant triggers the production/release of breast milk (along with prolactin and other hormones), so our survival as a species kinda depends on that response, and it extends to animals as well (this is for both sexes, men can actually produce breast milk with the help of prolactin injections). ;) 

/u/wonderlaend, feel free to disagree if you'd like. At the end of the day, this is advice for OP, so disagreement never hurts. 


EDIT: Oh, I forgot to mention, ""internet"" doesn't mean ""Facebook"". I'd suggest keeping social media accounts, but deleting the apps/shortcuts and not using it except to get in touch with someone or for 1-on-1 messaging. I've never really used Facebook or any other social media platform, and I can't say I feel like I'm missing out at all. "
1304,7rride,Ah. Have you considered taking fewer classes (I think you have to report it to the FA office) and/or pass/fail courses and/or easier courses this semester? 
1305,7rride,"I totally get you, I've been there, and that's why I don't want you to make the same mistake. 

The best advice I can give you is to get professional help ASAP.

You're welcome to message me if you want to talk about anything. Have a good day <3."
1306,7rride,"I'm not against online communities in general (otherwise, I wouldn't be here to begin with). I just said that because the subs you suggested are mostly filled with people ranting about their issues (especially /r/depression; and if you take a look at OP's profile, you can see that they've been spending quite a bit of time there). They also often mention things such as selfharm, suicide, and substance abuse, and such concepts become normalized in the culture of those subs. Asking questions is good, like ""How did you guys get through this?"", but reading about people attempting suicide every day is just not. In fact, people are more likely to attempt suicide after seeing / hearing about someone else who did it. That's why shows such as 13 Reasons or whatever it's called can lead to a temporary rise in suicide rates."
1307,7rride,i tried doing that last semester but shit just got worse in my life. I really don't want to try that again and screw up my degree even more. I really want to push through with at least 4 classes
1308,87cq7w,to think i went to an institution in the same echelon of sexual scandals and mental health issues as harvard and princeton~!
1309,87cq7w,Beaurocracy at McGill is exceedingly bad. Much more so than comparable institutions   
1310,87cq7w,"Like sure, McGill administration handles badly these issues, but don't forget you live in one of the most liberal cities in North America (probably in the world too). I doubt you'd find as many open minded people in the States."
1311,87cq7w,"I personally don't think posts phrased this way are super helpful. I understand where you're coming from and am completely for looking into issues at other institution, maybe for guidance on how we can improve and where we're going wrong in dealing with our own problems.

However, (I'm not sure if this is where you were going with this) but just wanted to put it out there that I don't think acknowledging serious issues at other universities should be used to make us feel better because other universities have problems too or that our institution isn't as bad in comparison."
1312,87cq7w,"I'll never understand how uninteractive some of the labs are in my program, and on top of it each semester students pay 50$ towards lab equipment seperate from their course fees. Value indeed."
1313,87cq7w,"It’s white men that are the problem, obviously."
1314,87cq7w,"No, it’s people like you"

1317,840llq,"Set a timeframe for when you work, could be mon-fri 8-5pm or 12pm-9pm and only allow yourself to focus on school within those times(maybe different for midterms), don't allow yourself to work outside of those hours. You then have a 40 hour a week schedule and scheduled free time, from there you just accept the grades you get with that amount of work. "
1318,840llq,"When I realize all these failures, tears, and stress won't matter in 5, 10, 15 years and I'll look back at this point in life and probably pat myself on the back for trying my best even though things don't always go my way. :)"
1319,840llq,"Well, your high expectations are probably tied to the fact that a lot of your self-worth is tied to your grades. Your mind needs something to tie your self worth to, and if it has nothing else, it puts all of the eggs in the GPA basket. Therefore, in order to lower your expectations, you need to ""spread out"" your self worth so that you aren't relying solely on your grades. This can come from anything: playing an instrument, developing a relationship, you name it. 

Since most McGill students work really well within the academic grading system, yourself most likely included, I would suggest pursuing something that has a really structured assessment format. 

For example, let's say you learn to play the piano. You can do RCM exams, which are structured much in the same way school exams would be. By pursuing that hobby, you'd give your mind something else to lean on other than your grades. 

Of course it doesn't need to be an instrument, but you get my drift. Just make sure you're achieving things outside of school and that you're taking pride in (i.e. placing self worth in) those achievements. "
1320,840llq,"I'm really only JUST getting to this point and I'm a fourth year; but it's a combo of realizing that there is a point of diminishing returns, and people in the future, they won't care about every little thing - so that's given me more breathing rooom now. "
1321,840llq,"Whatever your field is, there are things that are more important than grades. Focus on those ?"
1322,840llq,"I didn't lower my expectations but changed them. Decided to focus on what I could achieve through the numerous extra-curricular activities that McGill offers rather than obsess about my GPA.
And I ended up learning more stuff from my extra-curricular activities than my classes.
That said, I wasn't in a competitive department/degree."

1347,7gvm9y,"So true.  I mean, if I were a SSMU exec or something, I’d totally throw as much attention on this mental health stuff as possible to distract from the fact that the student “leaders” are a bunch of bullies who are slowly driving each other into the sanitarium."

(Any drama regarding the SSMU Senators?)"
1352,7kwrwc,"Yo, what else are you supposed to do when you get back a final that's 40% when you thought you got at least 75%? Just sleep?

I can guarantee you if it wasn't all the complaining, I'd be nuts a loooooong time ago. It's a way of letting your emotions go away, and works especially well when you got a friend who also needs to complain. If you don't let it out, well, it builds up the invisible pressure that WILL destroy you eventually. 

Most of the time we DONT need to talk and discuss about it because we all know the solution (i.e. study more or find the prof and argue), all we need is just to let it out and complain, nothing more, also because none of the people you talk to can help you(unless they do the exam for you, in that case, I'm calling the police). Don't put yourself above others as if all you need is serious discussion and never complain, we are all just normal humans, we need an outlet so we can be sane. 

It's just the tough times, we all know it, you virtually can't make someone happy when they got 6 finals and 2 papers (look at this dumb ass who decided to take 6 courses) over a week of time. When the break comes, everyone will calm their shit down and hopefully be happy."

1354,7kwrwc,This post cured my hygiene de vie
1355,7kwrwc,">Complaining about exams frequently will lead to unhappiness

I think TAKING  exams frequently lead to my unhappiness in the first place....."
1356,7kwrwc,[deleted]
1357,7kwrwc,"Living in constant negativity will lead to unhappiness. Thinking that you'll fail, saying that you'll fail, will lead you to believe that you'll fail, thus you'll act like you're going to fail, and achieve failure. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy and a vicious cycle as a lie said enough times eventually becomes the truth. So many people are unable to get these negative thoughts out of their heads and that's what, in part, leads to these academic issues. 

You aren't wrong in saying that we need to address our stress in constructive manners, go take a walk, do exercise, do something ELSE than worry. You're right, it's not hard and will most definitely help people like myself who have no real mental health issue. I'm just a student who does slightly more than the minimum required to stay on top of my classes and do okay. In the end, it bites me in the ass as I have to cram for all my finals and essentially REALLY learn the course material for several classes in perhaps two weeks or less (I'm being very generous on time here).

For a lot of us, we complain because it's the most time efficient way of venting and coping with our situations. You have to look at the root cause of an issue in order to resolve it, not just try to fix the symptoms. The reason why so many people complain all the time is because there isn't time in these last few weeks to do much else. 

For the last two weeks I've been getting up at 8:00~8:30, eating a little, studying until lunch, having a quick lunch, studying (at this point it's not too too efficient but fuck it caffeine helps), maybe eating supper, studying some more until around 9:30-10PM, entertaining myself until midnight or so, sleep and rinse-repeat. Fortunately for me, this works without being too damaging to my sanity as I learnt over my brief years at McGill what really matters (sleep). For others, this might not be the case and they cram only a day before, don't sleep, don't eat , and so on, which can be extremely taxing. Do they have time for typical life hygiene management? Eh, probably not and that's understandable, they don't want to fail. For a student without much real world perspective failing a class is the worst thing that's ever happened to them, and until they understand that failure happens and that it's not the end of the world, shit won't change. 

On the other hand, they should just study all semester long and avoid this situation, right? Yes, again, not wrong, but sometimes the situation doesn't really permit it. A lot of people are detached from the reality students face at McGill, one recent example is our current deputy provost. ""Don't cram a week before your exam!"", for some classes, I wish I had a whole week. Instead I'm learning new things in that class on Thursday the 7th of December and my final is on Friday the 8th. Neat. 

Different programs have different requirements and different people have different needs and what really bothers me in these kind of ""just take care lul"" messages shows a complete lack of understanding and makes me almost believe it's willful ignorance. In the end, the only thing that makes it easier for me is ranting and complaining with others who suffer through the same hardships as myself. Venting with friends and classmates is the only reason why I'm still in my program tbh. We've built such a nice sense of community by bonding over our common hardships. 

Does complaining lead to unhappiness? I don't think so, living negatively and unhappily does, complaining is one of the things making me remember that grades aren't all that matter and when I'm done, those grades I got won't really matter down the road. Also, this large rant has essentially reduced my stress and I can probably get back to studying now. 

Best of luck, don't take shit too seriously, and kick ass guys.

TL;DR: SLEEP & RANT MOTHERFUCKERS, IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANYTHING FOR YOUR SANITY."
1358,7kwrwc,WOW IT REALLY JUST NEVER OCCURRED TO ME TO STUDY RSPONSIBLITY THROUGHOUT THE SEMESTER THANKS
1359,7kwrwc,"But how ELSE will I burn time during final season? Oh, wait."
1360,7kwrwc,"Hey my dude, I appreciate the feedback.  Of course, I think its extremely important to take care of negative emotions that well up, and I dont wish to offend people by just telling them not to complain about their problems. But I believe there are much stronger ways that will let you compose yourself mentally that are so much more effective than that.  

Meditation, working out, reading, running, goal setting, etc are all things you can do that are so many times more effective than just venting out. "
1361,7kwrwc,"for people with mild mental health issues, this is good advice. however, for people with more severe mental illness, it is really hard for them to motivate themselves to do any form of hygiene de vie. At the same time, however, I do believe that the concept of 'mental illness' has lost a lot of meaning in terms of everyone using it as a explanation for issues with academic stress"
1362,7kwrwc,"The point about self-selecting into a group of negatively influencing people is really apparent to me. For example, if you're feeling positive about an upcoming exam but everyone you speak to begins the conversation with ""ugh I'm so stressed out, finals season sucks"", it really brings you down. It's hard to stay positive when everyone else is complaining."
1363,7kwrwc,"Venting is an appropriate coping strategy, especially when done right.  It is a way to get your feelings out, and can be used to share your frustrations with a friend who feels similarly and can help build social support networks. (Which meditation, working out, reading, running, etc don't really address.) Of course, those things can help you relieve stress and anxiety that might keep us from performing at our best. "

If you want to be seen on a regular basis (every week or every two weeks), you need to go see someone outside of McGill. Counselling is on a very limited budget, so people typically get appointments every 2-4 weeks, with limited exceptions. 

Also, they often book months ahead. They're catching up right now, but during exams this semester I asked the front desk a couple of times, and they said that they were booking into February. 

If you need more specific info, I know more than I care to admit about McGill's mental health system, so feel free to PM. 

Edit: Who did you see the first time? Always good to know. "

1374,7kj1qg,"Yea I was seeking advice from him on how to taper off my antidepressant. My non-specialist family doctor suggested a regime that would take me a total of 16 weeks to get off the drug (eg. From 20mg, Reduce dose by 2.5mg every 2 weeks). 

Dr. Franck had a way more confusing regime that involved me starting by taking a half-dose one day a week (eg. 6 days 20mg, 1 day 10mg, then 5 days 20mg, two days 10mg), and then once I'm down to 10mg seven days a week, I'd repeat the same thing with 5mg and then zero, taking a total of 21 weeks instead of 16 weeks.

 Needless to say, I went with my family doctor's advice and successfully weaned off my antidepressant. "

When I asked if there were any alternatives, he basically said ""nope, not really"", which is flat out false. When I dug further or asked about side effects, he dismissed everything. It's almost like his weekend job is with a drug company. 

The guy's solution to everything is to raise the dosage. Side effects? Raise the dosage. Not working? Raise the dosage. Different drug? Raise the dosage. At one point he had raised the dosage quite a few times. I did some research and found out that I was well above the recommended range of dosages, and usually the top end of those ranges is for people who are significantly taller and heavier than I am. 

Glad I got out of that one while I could. "

1381,7kj1qg,Yup. She was the first person in mental health that I talked to too and man did I feel like shit after I left her room.

1383,7y1gtl,"Hey, this might not seem very helpful, but you’re justified to see a therapist if you feel like you want to, need to, or that it would be helpful, there’s no magic threshold of “bad enough”, thinking you should is a pretty good indication that you should.

 I’d suggest trying to start with McGill counselling. It can be a bit difficult to get an appointment, but just keep calling, or go to the office in person (4th floor Brown building). Then you’ll have an in take appointment with a mental health professional (psychologist, counsellor, or social worker), and they can help you decide what would work best for your situation.

Edit: at mcgill, psychiatry is separate from counselling, they don’t do therapy, just prescribing/changing/refilling/stopping meds, but I think (could be wrong) you need a referral from a GP unless you need a safety appointment

Let me know if you have any other questions!"
1384,7y1gtl,"If you have the SSMU health & dental insurance (even if you don’t TBH, they won’t check) you can call the EmpowerMe hotline 1 844 741 6389"
1385,7y1gtl,"Hey, glad you are taking this initiative and opening up about it here. I agree with the other commenter that it can take a while to get an appointment at Counselling but you are definitely entitled to that if you feel like that is the best option for you. 

In the meantime, I'd like to recommend some other resources at McGill that you can look into while you wait for an appointment or decide that's the route you'd like to take. You already mentioned Nightline which is a good resource but like you said can be difficult to get a hold of. The Peer Support Centre is another option, run by students trained in active listening and are open 9am-7pm Monday to Friday. You can drop in any time or make an appointment on their website. They are a very good option if you feel you need someone to talk to in a non-judgmental, confidential way and they can also help you with making an appointment at Counselling or pursuing other resources."
1386,7y1gtl,"Counselling at McGill is an excellent idea, and while you wait if you need someone to talk to [Vent Over Tea](http://ventovertea.com/en/) does exactly that. You book a session with a trained volunteer and chat at a time that works for both of you in a cafe. Note that they're not professional therapists, but a lot of their listeners are studying at McGill to become therapists and are getting great training. 

I'm sorry Nightline was busy last night - hang in there! Your instinct is leading you in the right direction and it'll get better from here on out. "
1387,7y1gtl,"They already called me back, I have an appointment for next week

Thank you, honestly I think I just needed someone to say it "
1388,7y1gtl,"I waited until things started really going bad to start seeing a therapist. I agree entirely with this comment: if you think that you should go see one, I would recommend it. Worst comes to worst, you're not doing so bad after all and you made sure that you are okay.

Good luck :)"
1389,7y1gtl,"> you're justified to see a therapist if you feel like you want to, need to, or that it would be helpful, there's no magic threshold of ""bad enough""

This is so true."

1392,8d2qtz,It can help if your psychiatrist at McGill can attest to your mental state! Like write a letter for documentation
1393,8d2qtz,"I just wrote ""mental health"" last semester and it was accepted but idk apparently they’re being more strict this semester so you might want to give a bit more detail"
1394,8d2qtz,"I wrote something along the lines of ""As per the first time deferral pilot project, and due to extenuating circumstances, I will have to defer the exam"". Honestly, the whole point of the program is to help reduce the extreme stress of exams. So if you're eligible, you don't really have to worry about what you write. "
1395,8d2qtz,This semester they're definitely stricter than last semester about first time deferrals. Rather than writing only mental health try to give a detailed explanation of your situation. Also visiting Service Point in advance after submitting your application works.
1396,8d2qtz,"""Mental health"" typically works fine. FYI there's a thread dedicated to this topic. "
1397,8d2qtz,Thanks!!

1400,79xejv,">Our best professors are leaving to other universities or companies at an ever increasing rate.

The number of departing tenure-track faculty has stayed relatively constant at roughly 55-60 per year since Fortier took over in 2013 ([source, Fig 17](https://www.mcgill.ca/provost/files/provost/budget_book_fy2018_1.pdf)), which is pretty much exactly the same as it was under Munroe-Blum ([source, Fig. 6.2.7](https://www.mcgill.ca/provost/files/provost/doc_university_budgetbook_2015_2016_v20150709gj.pdf))

>We are not getting enough money from ANYWHERE to support the research

McGill's research funding increased by 15.7% last year, amongst the largest increases of any Canadian university ([source](https://www.researchinfosource.com/pdf/2017Top50List.pdf)). Since Fortier became Principal in 2013 McGill's research income has increased from $465m ([source](https://www.researchinfosource.com/pdf/Canada_s%20Top%2050%20research%20universities%202014.pdf)) to $547m ([source](https://www.researchinfosource.com/pdf/2017Top50List.pdf)), and McGill has gone from 4th in Canada to 2nd in Canada in terms of research income (same sources).

>If Big Suzy you cannot face the reality and CHANGE the situation, you should resign if you still have any bit of sense of shame left, and let more capable humans take over!

If /u/timetofuckingchange can't provide sources to backup their claims they should quit posting misinformation."
1401,79xejv,"idk if OP is being sarcastic or not-- but if you're serious, this post is ridiculous since Suze just got reappointed and there was JUST a massive window where they were calling on students to voice their input on issues like these
"
1402,79xejv,"McGill is a public university. Public universities are dependent on public funding. When public funding falters, there is a correlation with a drop in standings, especially with Asian universities massively investing in universities and climbing quickly. I'm not saying Fortier is doing a great job but it's kind of ridiculous to pin all of this on her."
1403,79xejv,I think there are a lot of factors and politics in running a University that you or I may not understand. It's easy to complain and judge but you don't know how hard it is to appease everyone unless you're actually within the administration. 
1404,79xejv,"Aight I may be a little over the top, but I just want to say, those buffons should have not given her another term so she can experiment with her failed strategies again! Since now it's been set, Suzy, do something better or get down!"
1405,79xejv,are you mcgill admin? you seem to always comment/post ranking-related information 🤔
1406,79xejv,"Okay, then let's face the rank drop. If we are doing so great in every aspect, WHY are we dropping in ranks?

The truth is, I have 0 idea why you are protecting the admins. The faculty who leave now are the core of the departments. For some departments at least, the profs that are leaving now are Canadian Research Tiers rather than assistant professors or professors who haven't done much in the field. If you want names, like Hayden from Physics (god how could we let him go), or Rogers in Chemistry (once a symbol of McGill chemistry) Numbers are not everything. 

Secondly, our goal together is to improve the university together, not 'oh we got this and that and there's no problem' and have selective hearing on the rank drops. Apart from that 1 discussion on rank drop that was proven useless by a lot of attendees, we have not faced this properly. 
"
1407,79xejv,"I think the dude is being somewhat sarcastic. Apart from that tho, good politicians might have been able to get more public funding(or at least less budget cut instead of sudden middle-year budget cut), and/or acquired more private donations and/or managed the budget better(I mean, look into the annual budget...). Not everything is her fault obviously, but I do think because of the situation in her first term, she shouldn't have continued onto the second term."
1408,79xejv,I think you are strongly underestimating the value of a measured point.
1409,79xejv,"Not McGill admin, just a student with an unhealthy interest in university rankings :)"
1410,79xejv,"> Okay, then let's face the rank drop. If we are doing so great in every aspect, WHY are we dropping in ranks?

I'm not disputing the fact that McGill has dropped in the world rankings.

>The truth is, I have 0 idea why you are protecting the admins

I'm not, [I have no qualms criticising Fortier when I believe she's underperforming](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/5owecr/jobs_and_the_fourth_industrial_revolution_suzanne/dcmjn6i/). I'm questioning the evidence upon which you're basing your claims.

“Numbers are not everything” seems like another way of saying “I prefer anecdotes to data”. When assessing the performance of an institution the size of McGill you need to look at the bigger picture, not the fact that two individuals left, however notable they may have been. I prefer data to anecdotes, so here’s some data for the departments you highlighted over the period that Fortier has been in charge:

Ranking 		| Rank 2013 | Rank 2017 (or latest available)

1411,79xejv,"To clarify the Rogers issue, we didn't ""lose"" him in the sense that we just let him go. First, he convinced the chem department to invest in a huge green chem department (i.e. the entire fucking building they built, which is not wholly bad because they have brought in a lot of good professors to fill it), and then a private investor convinced him to drop everything and move back to Texas to make materials out of shrimp or something. 

Not even Harvard could have convinced him to stay. He's a man driven by money, and at the end of the day, academia money always loses to private sector money. "
1412,79xejv,"I've seen people here be serious stating much more serious stuff, so I gave up on assuming people are sarcastic, but you might have a point.

Either way I agree with you, I just thought OP's rant was super excessive."
1413,79xejv,it's like tracking the depreciation of a car after you buy it :)
1414,79xejv,"I'm gonna throw most of my Reddit credibility behind /u/burgleurgle here. As someone who's seen behind the scenes as a senator, number *ARE NOT EVERYTHING* when it comes to rankings and you need to read the methodology before making assumptions. one good way to look at this is the consistency between rankings at MacLeans and the difference between QS and THE when there was a split (i forget it was QS with THE or ARWU with THE), but the methodology changed when they split leading to McGill falling because they ranked less favourably. 

Moreover everything burgleurgle has said is spot on with regards to research income and (such). My one disagreement is Suzanne's handling of Student Affairs (with regards to SSMU last year), she had no right to threaten to withhold funding under Quebec laws, however, should she not have intervened in that manner i think SSMU would be in a very different position, and I believe her approach to the recent fall situation has been very respectable. Also her approach to the resignation of Andrew Potter is leaving a lot of Faculty questioning her leadership which should be questioned ."
1415,79xejv,"> her approach to the resignation of Andrew Potter is leaving a lot of Faculty questioning her leadership

Why is that?"
1416,7yzbd5,"Hey Anisah! I have a broad question - often, students aren't really taken seriously at Senate. How should Senate caucus members use their position there to advocate for students as efficiently as possible? How should Senators make the most of the power they have in that particular decision-making space?"
1417,7yzbd5,"Hey! Great question.

Firstly, we always need to remember that *everyone* in that room is a senator, a faculty member has the same voting power as a student, so keeping that in mind helps. If a prof or anyone tries to talk over a student, we have to (politely) remind them that we are talking and to let us finish. Being firm and confident is *absolutely* crucial. 

Secondly, finding allies within the faculty who are not blindly siding with admin is also a good way to ensure students are heard. Being open to collaborating with faculty is a great way to give projects some legs and legitimacy. 

Lastly, maximizing the amount of engagement in committee work is important because the environment is much more conducive to discussion.

I hope that answered your question!

"
1418,7yzbd5,"Absolutely, thanks for the thorough answer!"
