0,seeking therapy from mental health for second time,bwid8m,4,"i was seeing a therapist once a week regularly at the counselling place in the Brown building. we wrapped up this semester and said bye - it was definitely implied that was the end of therapy etc. been hard trying to get by withut the weekly therapy, what do you think the chances are of me going back next semester and trying to set up therapy with the same therapist?","['it should be fine, there\'s never an ""end of therapy"" where they don\'t let you come back or smth lmao', 'I contacted PsyMontreal through McGill who set me up with the first therapist I’ve actually found helpful.

Otherwise, it’s about $100 a session', 'If you’re an international student, you can get 80% refund on therapist sessions up to 750$ a year with IHI (not much I know - although some therapists will lower their prices if you talk to them about it, but don’t expect high quality for low price). \n\nI find that a good therapist will keep the conversation interesting. If they don’t - trash them. It’s no use talking to an uninterested wall anyways. Mcgill counselling is nonsense - they’re just there to prevent shooters hehe', 'second this!

1,Mental health services app,by1i7m,0,"Hey Reddit!

Mental health is something that has affected my life as well as loved ones in my life, and it breaks my heart to see students finally getting the courage to reach out, yet being met with something that doesn't quite work for them. I passionately believe this is something that should be fixed. So, I am working on a user-based application system that will recommend McGill mental health services so that students can better navigate based pm what worked for others in similar situations. In order to do this, we need a database of basic user profiles and reviews of services you've used-- don't worry this will be completely anonymous and private. 

Here is the form if this might apply to you:

2,Is the mental health clinic open during summer?,biwtym,3,"I've been putting off dealing with mental health issues until after exams. I am wondering if the mental health clinic will still be open during the summer holiday. If so, are the hours the same as during the regular year? Thanks.","['Yes, they are.', ""I've been told that counselling does continue through the summer, I plan on taking advantage of it myself. Might be reduced hours though."", ""Counselling is open and according to the counsellor I've been seeing, they get less busy in the summer because there are far less people here. Can't say for sure how accurate that is though bc this will be my first summer using their services.""]"
3,Can a mental health crisis be a valid reason for an exam deferral or deadline extension?,b1cbg4,11,Can something like a mental breakdown or even something like a suicide attempt be used as a valid reason for exam deferral or deadline extension? What kind of a note would one have to acquire for proof of such an event and would it come from a hospital or a medical professional who has conducted a psychiatric evaluation? Apart from personal reasons also asking because I have seen individuals have quite severe mental breakdowns due to academic pressures and it just seems like some sort of academic aid should be in order for them? For example someone not being able to sleep for a few days before their exam due to stress and constantly crying seems like quite an extreme state to be in and its really sad to see people in such a state where it seems like there is no mercy for them from the academic system.,"['At the risk of giving an unpopular opinion (I welcome the downvotes!), if one is feeling suicidal and this is directly connected to one\'s academic experience or stress from school, this individual should leave school immediately and receive proper medical attention and help. There are many students who are under the same stress and pressure (if not more) and are not suicidal, so there are likely underlying reasons and causes that need immediate attention that have nothing to do with school or McGill. I don\'t think a deferral solves those issues. Now, there is a pretty big leap from ""suicide attempt"" to feeling exam stress and crying. I have a hard time empathizing with individuals who pathologize normal emotions like exam stress/anxiety or crying. When I am stressed about exams I ask myself why. Am I stressed because I did not effectively manage my time so now I am behind and am most likely going to be obliterated by the final? Am I stressed because I incline toward magnifying exams to be something grander that what they really are, even though I am totally prepared and just need to put in the time? Am I stressed because I am comparing myself to others, and in my own perception everyone appears better than me, no matter how hard I work? Am I stressed because I experience the horror of the world as I scroll through my Facebook (rather than focusing on the infinite beauty that can be seen in a rain drop off the wing of a butterfly)? Am I suffering from a depression that is becoming more severe and unmanageable and school is making it worse because I am not able to focus on my mental health in a way to begin rebuilding my psyche? etc etc etc. But the long short of it...the moment the word suicide is brought up, the individual needs to leave school immediately and get help. To use it as an attempt to defer an exam...that sounds like another kind of pathology. Again, sorry about the unwelcome opinion. Confirmation bias helps nobody.', 'Mental health isn’t usually treated that well in the states, but a mental health crisis is just as important to treat as a physical health crisis. If you’re having mental problems: see a professional. Not only will they provide you with assistance (usually), but they’ll provide you with undeniable documentation that you need for protocol-friendly authorities (teachers). If you don’t have documentation, you’re leaving the extension call to the will/trust of the teacher. Wish you luck. Get help if you need it. ', 'I was able to get a final exam deferral last semester due to stress induced insomnia. I literally couldn’t sleep for more than 2 hours at a given time because of how much my mind felt like I needed to be working. Every 2 hours, I’d wake up, wired, thinking I needed to work, and couldn’t go back to sleep. I went to the clinic the day of my exam, waited 4-5 hours, got a doctor’s note and my exam deferred. ', 'Yes, there are so many things you can do. I wish I knew more about my options earlier. Firstly, if you are in immediate crisis, having suicidal plans go to the ER. You can also go to the McGill clinic and talk to a doctor, they can give you a medical note and refer you to psychiatric services if needed, the only thing is that psychiatric services have a pretty long wait so if you have options elsewhere take them. Then go to Counselling services. They have crisis walk in hours and you can also call to make an appointment.  \nAnother incredibly important resource is the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD). They can help you communicate with your professors, help you with exam accommodations etc. To me the most helpful part of the OSD was having a contact there, so when I was having a crisis I knew who to call first and they would help me see the steps I needed to take to move forward.  \n', ""yes! it is an absolutely valid reason! don't invalidate your situation – would you say the same thing to someone who had a broken leg? or pneumonia? a mental health crisis is every bit as valid. \n\nyou'll need to get a letter from a psychologist/psychiatrist/physician (who i hope you are seeing already) explaining that you're suffering from great personal distress etc., but it's 100% a valid reason. you should also consider getting a referral from your mental health professional to write your exams with the OSD. they won't help for a deferral or extension but they will try to accommodate any issues that may arise while writing an exam.\n\ni hope things get better. please take care of yourself <3 "", 'Yes. Just need a note or other documentation.', 'following', ""This is a valid argument but I'd like to disagree and explain why. Some mental health conditions are chronic, so even if you drop everything and focus on your mental health you never know when it's going to come back in full swing. In fact needing to drop all your classes because you are having a breakdown, loosing all the hard work you did prior in the semester, is very harsh.   \n\n\nAnd yes of course there is a difference between being stressed for an exam and that stress affecting you so badly that you cannot function for days on end and suicide attempts are of course a very large leap from that, but for someone who has an illness, it's not that wild of a leap. But your line about there being students with more pressure on them not feeling that way is a dangerous thing to say. I didn't get help for years because I kept thinking that I didn't have the right to be depressed. My life was great, I shouldn't be allowed to feel this way. I felt so much shame, I bottled it in, and I had a complete crash at one point, planning to end my life, but I still felt that I didn't deserve help, because I had no right to feel this way. Luckily for me, people close to me realized what was going on and I was rushed to the ER. So please think twice before you say something like that again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've gotten a lot of help, but there are no underlying problems in my past that explain away my depression. It's probably partly genetic, when I opened up about it I found out that about half my extended family is dealing with some form of depression or related mental illness. There is a chance that I will need to be on medication my entire life (I'm hoping not), but medication is also unpredictable, it can suddenly stop working the same way, my mental health can take a turn, and stress and physical illness can actually be triggers for things like that. So all the wonderful help that I am getting from the university and the health care system, is essential for me to finish my degree.  \n\n\nSome people would argue that people with chronic mental conditions that affect their academic life just shouldn't get higher education. I hope I don't need to explain why that's an awful opinion to have."", 'I’m probably going to hell for agreeing with you, but at the risk of ALSO sounding like a dick, I always cringe a little when I see folks on this sub or elsewhere having full-blown breakdowns over this kind of stuff. It’s a fucking school exam, come on, not a cancer diagnosis— the world won’t end if you do poorly, or even if you fail.  I know a lot of people have legitimate mental health issues and need treatment, and I don’t normally like playing Suffering Olympics, but Christ on a cracker, let’s have some maturity and perspective. \n\nI also have to wonder how much of it is performative in a way and egged on by other students— if you’re not on the verge of mental collapse, clearly you’re not working hard enough. ', ""This  is a reasonable opinion for the most part, but to clarify I'm not talking about people crying due to exam stress, I'm talking about someone manically sobbing to the point that they can't sleep or function for days on end. I've witnessed this kind of crippling stress in people before and I agree maybe they  should be away  from school seeking psychiatric help for what is likely a deeper rooted issue, but it hardly seems reasonable to put humans through such pain and suffering for an exam without giving them an honest chance at redeeming themselves. I guess this overall question just stems from my  perception of academia being quite unmerciful and causing a lot of suffering and stress in young people that just seems so unwarranted, as so many of us will look at an individual exam as being detrimental to our possibility of being successful or happy in life."", "">There is a chance that I will need to be on medication my entire life (I'm hoping not)\n\nI've never understood this, especially when it comes to medications like SSRIs and SNRIs (which can take up to a month to work properly). If you don't think you need your medication anymore, that means the drugs are *working.* Going off them can actually cause a severe relapse in mental health, and when you get back on them afterwards, it might never work the same for you again. \n\nThere is a huge societal push to get off medications, and I've had shitty psychologists make that their end goal. However, it can be dangerous to do so, especially if you have a family history of depression and mental illness. \n\nWhen I went off medication because of that societal cue, it royally fucked me up. I couldn't take the old medication anymore, and it took two more medications to find one that worked again. That was three months of CEGEP I couldn't get back, and it made getting into McGill much harder. \n\nI'm fine now, but I would warn anyone on long term medication to only change it under the supervision of a psychiatrist, not based off of personal feelings.

4,Warning on Studentcare Mental Health Coverage,awi1f8,4,"Hi, 

Just wanted to give a warning to anyone else who plans on using StudentCare's mental health coverage. It's supposed to cover 80% up to $500. 

Before taking any service or treatment make sure to send an invoice or pre-claim to the brokerage company. They are very specific on what they cover, and even if they give you false or incomplete info over the phone - they won't reimburse you if your claim doesn't match Desjardins specific criteria. 

Finally, their complaints process is a never ending deniability circle between StudentCare and Desjardins. 

&#x200B;","['Just out of curiosity, what was the reason for the denial? I haven’t experienced any issues with the coverage. ', 'Same here ', ""Basically I tried out BetterHelp since it's prohibitively expensive to get in person counselling. When I called Studentcare and explained I would be getting e-counselling from a US provider, they said it would be covered as long as the service is provided in English and provided I include the licence number of the practitioner. \n\nBut when I submitted my claim, I got denied since in the US they have a LPC (licensed professional counselor) but that's not recognized in Canada or by Desjardins. So now, I'm out +$200 and in the process of complaining. I mean if you are going to provide incomplete info on the phone and then blame me for acting on it...what can I say?"", ""Not so much the denial of coverage, it's their lack of oversight or complaints evaluation that worries me.\n\nOther than Studentcare, no one else can intervene or appeal their decisions at the moment. On their complaints page, the 1st step is to contact ASEQ (Studentcare's parent company?). After 2 calls, lasting an hour each, I was told I would be called back by a supervisor - didn't happen after either call. Had to call a 3rd time, about a month later to follow up, finally managed to get a hold of a supervisor. Didn't help though, claiming it's Desjardin who makes the claims decisions.\n\n Then the 2nd step of the complaints process is to contact Desjardins - but they just say they can't handle student coverage. Desjardins redirects the call directly to ASEQ. Voila - the infinite bureaucratic loop. \n\nThe 3rd final step is to contact the regulating body of brokerage and financial companies in Quebec (autorité des marchés financiers). After reaching out to them, I was told to submit an official written complaint with both Desjardins (the actual insurance provider) and ASEQ (the brokerage company). Now, I'm waiting for them to get back to me. ""]"

9,Not sure whether i need to get mental health help,a6iu1j,6,"This is my second year here. In 17fall term i experienced serious mental health problem maybe because it’s my first year to go to another country for education. I must play some comedies thru my mobile phone but even this i can cry or be crazy for no reason. I thought it just because I’m too stressed out so i didn’t care about it. But it becomes more serious, 18winter term during a night i have some dangerous thought about suicide and even write my last letter to my families and friends.

On 18fall, i mean this term, it is more and more serious. I begin to insomnia seriously, like i will not be sleepy until 4 or 5am, and even i sleep late i can only be asleep for 4-5 hours at most. Just little things can make me crazy and let me cry, even things like “the weather is so cold, i feel freezing” makes me cry crazily alone at my apartment. And i sometimes really want to break and throw things or even want to kill others just because little accident.

As u can see, I cannot concentrate on my studies because i always stick into this cycle. I’m not sure whether i need to take a mental health help because I’m afraid taking medicine will make me worse and have a loss in my gpa. Now my gpa is just around 2.8 but i need a much higher than that for graduate school, or, I hate to say, my dream and future.

Not sure what to do now i even want to drop out of mcgill but i don’t know what i can do with a senior school degree...","[""Message me! I went through something similar. Also graduate school is more focused on your last two years (and depending on your faculty, your research experience) my GPA was much lower than a 2.8 after second year and I still have how's of graduate school!"", 'I do think getting mental health help could be really beneficial for you. This doesn\'t sound like fun situation at all. Mental health problems can evolve into physical health problems if they\'re not addressed early enough. You should also be proud of achieving a 2.8 despite what you\'ve been going through. \n\nMany graduate schools will only look at your GPA for your last two years of study, so since you are a second year, you still have room for improvement!\n\nHow many classes are you taking? I would drop your course load down to 4 classes/semester (12 credits). You can then do an extra semester and graduate half a year later, but with much better grades and mental health! Doing so will still keep you a full time student. If your parents are not too understanding of mental health struggles, you can say that you are doing this to increase your GPA for graduate school applications, which wouldn\'t be wrong.\n\nFor the insomnia, I would look into ""sleep hygiene"", see this [handout](https://www.anxietycanada.com/sites/default/files/SleepHygiene.pdf). This is the first action a doctor will recommend, so you might as well try it before you see one. Otherwise, we now have options for sleep medications that aren\'t addictive.\n\nFor the mental health problems, I would go to a walk-in clinic (I assume you don\'t have a family doctor as an international student?) so they can refer you to the appropriate resources. I also recommend you take advantage of the free counselling services at McGill. Right now there will be a longer wait list, but it\'s better to be on a long waitlist than on no waitlist at all!\n\nFor counselling in the meantime, I recommend looking up ""sliding scale psychotherapy"" in Montreal. These places charge you according to income, so they won\'t charge you as much as a student. Additionally, [SSMU health insurance covers 500$ of therapy per year](http://www.studentcare.ca/rte/en/McGillUniversityundergraduatestudentsSSMU_Health_HealthCoverage_HealthPractitioners_Psychologists), covering 80% each visit.

I’m in Phil major and i don’t know what i can do without graduate school degree..', 'Im a Philosophy major who finished his degree just a few days ago. First, I want to stress what u/sprainedanklee  pointed out: graduate school focuses mostly on your last two years. You are expected to adjust to the requirements of the program at first, and later excel. For instance, I was below a 3.0 after my first year, and now im graduating north of 3.5. You WILL get better grades if you adequately adjust, go talk to your professors during their office hours, and put in the required time for the assessments. In fact, I suggest starting assignments the day you get the instructions in order to (i) relieve any anxiety, (ii) discuss your topic with your professor, and (iii) edit and revise. That always worked for me. I strongly suggest talking to the professors in the department - as in my experience they are very approachable - as well as familiarizing yourself with the mental health resources on campus. Should you have any specific questions, please feel free to message me...Lastly, try to not focus too much on what will happen in a few years - such as graduate school - and rather focus on what will happen in the immediate future: the courses you are taking. Only by doing well now can you set yourself up to do well later. Take it a day at a time.', ""I'm in CS/bio. I'm not very familiar with philosophy but I would do some googling! From what I can tell if you can show that you have the critical thinking skills one would expect to gain in a philosophy major, you could go towards working in the government or various administrative jobs, maybe journalism, maybe therapy?

10,How good are student mental health services?,9zqpbw,9,"So we all know the student health clinic is bananas bonkers bad, but how is student mental health? Have you had a good experience with student mental health services? Did you find the staff to be competent? ","['I went to counselling last year and it was pretty good for being free actually. Some of the counsellors are psyc graduate students and don’t have that much experience but they are helpful. I was going to counselling for more light-hearted stuff and didn’t need any medication. I had Aislinn and quite liked her actually, but she is one of the younger and prob less experienced ones. Your first appointment is with the supervisor and  I’m guessing depending on how severe the case is she matches you with someone that is experienced enough to fit your needs. ', 'i have had my fair share of ups and downs with mcgill mental health (both counselling and psych) and here are my three biggest pieces of advice:\n1. get help early. mental health services are wildly underfunded and understaffed and as the semester progresses this only becomes more and more evident. it takes a very long time for things to get done! expect to wait weeks/months for appointments (especially if it\'s your first time) and do not let things get to the point of needing a crisis appointment because these appointments aren\'t usually very helpful and fill up very quickly (they\'re made on a first come first serve basis) later in the semester the already outrageous wait times for appointments get even longer so make sure to get help ASAP and if it does end up getting to the point of crisis i would highly suggest going to the hospital instead\n2. be persistent! because the services are so underfunded and understaffed they will suggest the easiest course of action that they believe still fits your needs. they will push group sessions and impersonal workshops/lectures. they will push using the peer support center. these are all great resources, but if you\'re looking for more serious one on one therapy or psychiatry then you need to be persistent. you have to state clearly what services you need and do not budge. they will find a way to accommodate your needs but only if you are persistent and confident in voicing them. do not say things like ""oh i was just hoping to..."" or ""i think it might be helpful if..."" go in with a clear purpose and say ""this is what is happening and this is what i want to help me get through it"" this applies for the duration of your care. too many people find the psychiatrists here unhelpful because they aren\'t being assertive in what they would like. yes the doctor knows the most about medicine, but when it comes to your brain, your body, and your needs then you are the expert. tell your psychiatrist what you want even if it goes against what they say and if they still won\'t help you out do not be afraid to request a different doctor. \n3. finally, keep ur expectations realistic. many counsellors are just grad students who are, frankly, not as great as an actual therapist would be. but at the end of the day, they are much better than nothing! do not expect to have ur issues resolved immediately. working on mental health is a long process and at mcgill mental health services its even longer. stay positive, stay realistic, and stay healthy. good luck!', 'Personally, I\'ve found counselling quite useless. They just asked me the stereotypical ""so how does that make you feel?"", but once you go to psychiatric services, things are great. My psychiatrist is knowledgeable and very very insightful. Would recommend McGill psychiatric services to everyone.', ""I'm not sure how other psychiatrists at McGill treat their patients but mine was completely and utterly non-understanding of my issues and all in all felt like he didn't care one bit about what was going on with me, or even about me as a person. (His name is Robert Franck).\n\nI had to miss an appointment so I couldn't renew my prescription that we had started together. I called to set up a new appointment but of course he was fully booked for a couple weeks before I could see him (even though I explained to the receptionist that I needed to re-fill my prescription, because the medication (+ the dosage) I was on said that there were horrible side effects if stopped immediately). The receptionist told me to file for a renewal from the pharmacy - but no answer from Frank. He had originally given me his email for questions and concerns - no answer when I described the situation I was in. I ended up ending the medication abruptly (this was in December... finals season), and of course had horrible side effects of increased depression, delusions, and 'brain zaps' which greatly effected my performance at the end of the semester (where grades counted the most). I didn't bother going to my next appointment, and he never followed up on me. I sought help during the winter break with my family doctor back home.  \n\nWhat I am still perplexed with to this day is **why** go into a profession that entails being compassionate and understanding of other people when you don't give a crap about them in the first place?? We don't need you. He truly made my situation worse.\n\nAgain - this was just one doctor, not representative of all of them at McGill.

11,I'm looking for mental health help,9u5squ,7,"I can feel depression, anxiety, overwhelming feeling kicking in. 

I need some professional help. 

Do you know where I can get the help I need. 

(no joke please) ","[""A lot of people seek on-campus mental health service around midterms/finals because anxiety and depression start to kick in. As a result, the wait list can be very long. Depending on how urgently you think you need it, you can either a) put yourself on the waitlist or b) try to find off-campus services, though you will need to pay for these on your own, so it kind of depends on your financial situation. \n\nEither way, the process of getting one-on-one help often takes a while, so in the meantime, I would suggest the following:\n\n - If your academic life is one of the main things causing it, then don't be afraid to step back. You could try to withdraw (do this sooner rather than later if you intend to) from one or more courses to ease the burden. Make sure you go out once in a while and experience things other than the thrill of solving one integral after another. Keep in mind that a mediocre semester isn't the end of the world, and that many people have been worse off academically than you and have gone on to be very successful. \n\n - Check out the McGill Nightline. The number of users has gone up substantially over the past couple of years, to the point where they've gotten an increase in funding. If you need someone to just listen while you vent, this is an excellent resource. You might be nervous or hesitant at first, but chances are that 5 minutes in, you'll be glad you did it, and if it's not for you, you can always end the conversation. \n\n - McGill has group counselling workshops with various topics such as relationships, dealing with anxiety, speaking in front of others, and various things like that. If you think it might help, try it out. You're not obligated to show up again if you don't find it useful. \n\n - If you feel comfortable, pick up the phone and call somebody. Maybe your mom, a friend, a sibling, or whoever else you feel OK talking to. \n\n - I'm not sure if Vent Over Tea is available right now, but you basically meet up with one of their volunteers, go for coffee, and talk about whatever you want. It doesn't have to be about the things going on in your life, but it can be. People really like it because it's anonymous and you get to sit down with someone face to face. \n\n - If you need an anonymous back and forth with someone who is familiar with the McGill environment, then PM me or someone else on this sub. There are a lot of great people here who are willing to help you out, even if that just means PMing back and forth or having coffee. There was a group of people a couple of months ago who even organized group events for people who felt lonely. Sometimes it also helps just to browse through past posts (like Real Talk Friday) and be able to relate to things that people talk about. Obviously this isn't a substitute for professional help, and I'm not trying to brand it as such, but it does make you feel less alone in the world of McGill. \n\n - Lastly, if you're feeling suicidal and think you might be at risk of hurting yourself, seek help ASAP. Go to the hospital, go to Mental Health Services and get an urgent care appointment, or go find another person and stay with them. If someone knocked on my door, even in the wee hours of the morning, and asked for help, you can be sure as shit that they'd get as much of my time as they wanted and their choice of tea from my collection, and I think everyone else would do the same for a fellow human being. You can ask someone else to take you to the hospital (they're open 24/7) if you want, or if nobody's around and none of the above are options, at least get on the phone with someone. Don't hesitate to call 911. There is nothing so insurmountable that you can't work through it. \n\n*Hugs*"", 'Please have a look at the sidebar (on old.reddit.com/r/mcgill).

You can find help and support and I really hope you do. "", 'The McGill health services can have a long wait, especially around finals.

12,What is McGill's responsibility to mental health? Are they required to provide a certain standard of care?,8eifri,76,"I was having this conversation with my friends, and there is a lot of talk on campus about how McGill doesn't do enough for mental health, and that it needs to do more. I was wondering, because I genuinely don't know: what is McGill's responsibility here? Are they obligated to provide a certain standard of mental health services? 

Because technically they are just an educational/research institution, and I guess I would assume they don't *have* to provide any mental healthcare, but they provide it anyway. I'm not  sure if it's because they have to or because it's considered an amenity? Has McGill promised a certain standard and they're not delivering on it? Or do people just think they *should* do more? What are McGills obligations to mental health as opposed to going to off-campus mental health services? I am confused and don't know.

I'm not trying to be controversial or offensive, it is a genuine question have because I'm not really sure.","['This is a very ""yes and no"" type of question. *Should* McGill have to offer these kinds of services? Absolutely not; we should have a better MH care system where public clinics are not completely overloaded and private clinics are better accessible through insurance. Unfortunately, we live in a province, and a country, where mental health care is abysmal. As an institution that a) has a population which would add tremendous strain to the local public clinics b) has the resources, I think it\'s more than fair for McGill to offer these services.\n\nHowever, just because including psychiatry + counselling in student health services is the Canadian standard doesn\'t mean they have to (other schools\' health pages just say ""lol go to the clsc""). And when a school chooses to run this kind of clinic, they should be held to the same standard as any other similar service. Here McGill is good because it is confidential, which is unfortunately not the case in other schools, especially in the states; on the other hand, the standard of care is not great. If they can\'t find a clinic director (which they didn\'t have for a while) and willing clinicians, they shouldn\'t be running a service that isn\'t up to par. \n\nHaving been v mentally ill in two provinces, I can tell you many of the things we complain about, like wait times and feeling rushed through your appointments, are basically the standard for public mental health care. That being said, McGill does fail to deliver on what it promises IMO, especially when you consider a) their total lack of specialists, especially at counselling b) their inability to treat many common illnesses c) their by-the-book approach to symptoms and how those ""should"" present.\n\n\nTL;DR McGill doesn\'t need to do this, but IMO because it does it has a responsibility to ensure the service meets the general standard of similar clinics. \n\n\np.s. i hit delete instead of edit the first time im so heartbroken', ""I think to some extent if an educational institution pretends to shape the best students and to produce the best kind of workers (lawyers, doctors, etc.) they should care about their student's well-being (physical and mental). It's obvious that academic success requires mental and physical well-being, there's nothing new under the sun here.\n\nThe issue is this university has over 20 000 students. \n\nSo like I said in another thread, because the university can't cover everyone's mental needs we should have access to external clinics with reduced fares.\n\nIt's actually ridiculous that mental health (except psychiatry) isn't covered by the system."", 'Does anyone proposing that mcgill fully takes care of mental health services actually have a viable financial plan for it?

It’s really nice to have convictions about mental health and how everyone should have access to these services for free (how can you not agree with this) but it’s a totally different game to actually fund it and put your money where your convictions are. I’d be curious to hear pro-mental health at mcgill people pitch some source of funding / financial plan for it.', 'This is a very different angle, but a person could argue that McGill provides a service that is notorious for causing mental health problems, and as a result they have a responsibility to provide care for it. \n\nThis happens in many other cases. For example, if a type of labour presents a hazard, the worker is compensated (often simply through higher pay). If a person is injured at work, their employer often has to pay their medical bills. When child actors are on a set, the production company has to pay for the schooling they\'re missing out on. \n\nIt would make sense for McGill to be obligated to pay if their ""service"" causes mental health issues. \n\nUniversity and mental health aren\'t entirely separate. A lot of people wouldn\'t have mental health issues if it weren\'t for university (though some obviously would), and that\'s why you could argue that McGill has an obligation.

There are so many things at McGill that are just nice things to have that don't bring in income and aren't necessary, but are still there, and I think that before having any of those things we should have proper mental health services.\n\nAnd why can't they neglect one thing to favour another?

Some of the unionized workers' that disagree with the mental health policies @ McGill? Even SSMU / other student groups off campus?

Like there is a lot of pre-existing resources and past campaigns to push for better awareness and care around mental health at McGill.\n\nThis is a much better place to start organizing whatever than on reddit"", 'we also need a rally for better student advising services. seriously like 6 advisors for ALL science students at mcgill?! whata joke', '[deleted]', ""Hiya! I love where your head's at! I'm gonna echo Zaratustash & taytots505 and suggest getting a feel for what the current situation is / what's being done right now with regard to this issue. The groups and orgs that have been listed already are doing great stuff, and I'm sure you'd get some good context + ideas by reaching out to them. For more context about the state of mental health services at McGill, I'd recommend checking out some of the media coverage this issue has gotten over the past few years (both in the student press + mainstream media). That should give you a sense of what advocacy has already been done, and how admin + Student Services tend to respond to student pressure. And last but not least, if you're serious about the possibility of mobilizing students around mental health this year, shoot an email to my colleague Sophia Esterle at studentlife@ssmu.ca - Sophia is the SSMU exec whose portfolio is most closely tied to mental health, and she's super passionate about this topic! If you do reach out to Sophia, I'd love it if you cc'd me as well (Marina Cupido - external@ssmu.ca) since my portfolio deals with student campaigns, and I could hook you up with folks beyond McGill who are doing mental health work. Hope this helps, and best of luck with whatever you decide to do - there's a massive amount of progress to be made on improving mental health services at McGill and reducing stigma!"", 'Okay, just some questions/comments about this:\n\n1. What would you like the university to do? If you have very specific and reasonable asks of McGill, the admins will probably be more likely to listen than if you come in guns blazing just demanding they be ""more aware"" of mental health without offering any tangible solutions (or by being blatantly disrespectful). If you do the latter, there\'s a strong chance that they don\'t bat an eye to the issue. \n\n2. Don\'t block doors/exits to buildings or block city traffic. First of all, blocking doors is a violation of fire safety code. Second of all, don\'t make life a living hell for people who have nothing to do with this issue. Causing that kind of disruption is more likely to land you in handcuffs than cause a palpable change on campus.\n\n3. What is the precise goal of this march/rally? Many of the ""protests"" we see nowadays tend to not have very specific goals in mind and if they do, they\'re not ones that your average Joe can do anything about. To reiterate my first point, if you just tell McGill admins to be ""more aware"" of mental health they probably will say there\'s not much they can do. But if you offer specific steps they can take towards tackling this issue, they might actually sit down with mental health groups on campus and try to figure something out.\n\n4. More specifically to mental health: I think mental health awareness has been raised over and over again. And let\'s not forget the obvious which is that people without certain mental health issues cannot fully feel/understand the struggles that individuals who do have these challenges face.   \n\nNow let\'s cut to the chase...to be brutally honest, I don\'t think any sort of rally is going to result in any noticeable change or improvements to mental health on campus. Again, I\'d love to see the university improve their services and do more for students with mental health problems, but I also wonder how much they\'re even allowed to do to begin with. For all we know they have some legal or bureaucratic roadblocks that make the fight for necessary improvements nearly impossible. That being said, keep the fight going because it certainly is a good cause, but consider other approaches to this issue other than a disruptive rally (one that is unlikely to result in any real positive outcome).', ""Do you know any of those clubs?

17,McGill Mental Health Services Any Good?,86kknp,11,"I feel like it's urgent for me to see a counselor/therapist. I have been going through some intense anxiety and depression for the last two months and now i feel like i finally have the guts to go get help now.

I used McGill Mental Health Services in the Brown Building 2 years ago, but it was an awful experience. I got into a drop-in session and the guy just gave me meds as a quick fix and didn't seem to really care what i had to say. I decided to switch counselors, but my new counselor got mad at me about me switching which i thought was extremely weird. 

Overall my experience was quite poor, and i was wondering if the services there have improved now? How long would the wait be? Or if there are any better menta health clinics in the city that are worth seeing?","['Yes and no.  The waitlist is fffffffffffffff*ffffffffffuckedddd*, but once I actually got in, it help itself was effective.', ""they actually aren't that bad but aren't that good. don't let all the complaining about services stop you from reaching out. they are there and they will help you to the best of their abilities in my experience but beware that they are ridiculously short staffed and may not be able to see you today. "", ""If you have been before, you might be able to get a safety appointment which is much faster. Otherwise, especially at this time of year, the waitlist is quite long. I'm sorry, it's not a very good system. They told me they don't have the resources to talk to everyone who feels sad which is........ a professional thing to say to someone with depression I guess. But good luck. Just know that now counseling and psychiatric are separate so the one side won't want to counsel and the other won't be able to prescribe.  "", 'No. ', ""I did not appreciate the help I got from them. But still, don't hesitate to reach out even if it's outside McGill."", ""I would say that it's still worth a try. Like what the others say, Mental Health Services is decent, though not necessarily outstanding, after you get past the waitlist stage. The wait time is typically about a month at this time of year for a counsellor, and 2-3 weeks for a psychiatrist. Make sure you know what help you need because counsellors can't prescribe meds and psychiatrists don't really counsel. Some students will end up requiring both services and in such cases you'd need to make separate appointments for both. \n\nMeanwhile, to tie you through until your appointment, you can go have a look at TAO (Therapist Assisted Online) [here](https://www.mcgill.ca/counselling/getstarted/tao), which has online videos and tutorials in CBT/mindfulness that may assist in relieving the symptoms of various mental illnesses (depression, anxiety). It's not a full substitute for professional advice, but it doesn't harm to try it out. \n\nAh and as for medications, I've actually gotten from them a walk-in clinic off-campus, since you technically don't need to see a psychiatrist to get antidepressants. However, if you do go for this route, make sure you ask for a referral to a psychiatrist at the same time so you can get an appointment with McGill psychiatry to stay updated regarding your medications. "", ""Don't let the thought of a long waitlist stop you from reaching out - they might have a cancellation and could fit you in earlier. In the meantime, even though they are closed since the SSMU closure, check out Peer Support Centre and Nightline, which I believe is still open.\n\nEdit: The Peer Support Centre is open again in their new location!"", 'Note: International insurance covers 750$ a year of psychologist/psychiatrist expenses outside mcgill (80% per session). Dunno the national policy but I bet it’s even better. \n\nMcgill’s been pretty helpful for me in terms of therapy. Can’t say much about the group workshops, but i meet about once a week with a nice lady and i’ve found it useful to identify issues and create strategies to tackle them. Mostly depression and anxiety, along with background baggage. \n\nLife is shitty hard and it takes initiative more than anything to deal with it. If they meet you to interview you make sure you have a clear idea of what you need help with and what it is that you want to get out of it. Bad communication leads to bad assignment of resources; so you’ll probably be unhappy w their offer if you aren’t clear. It’s ok to not know or understand yourself, but then say that.

I love my current psychiatrist, but I've seen some other people in the past who did more harm than good. "", 'I agree with several of the comments on this thread. It really depends who you get, and the wait list IS painfully long (2 months in my case). More importantly, I think, is how open you are to talk-therapy. While getting advice from a professional counsellor might provide you with temporary solace, McGill Counselling makes a pretty big point of telling you that it’s temporary. I was referred to an outside clinic (that would have to be covered by provincial/private insurance) after my first session. They (McGill) booked a second appointment for me but maintained their position as a “temporary solution” for students. If you’re cool with that, go for it. ', ""Counselling I've had good experiences with, psychiatry not so much. \n\nThe only thing is that as exams approach, the waitlist gets longer and longer. We're pretty close to finals already, so it would have been best for you to make an appointment earlier in the semester. You can still try, but there's a good chance that you won't get in for more than one appointment for the remainder of the year, especially since they end earlier (I think) than everyone else (something like halfway through April). Once you get in it's really good though. ""]"

Personally, I've found McGill to be downright brutal at times in terms of the expectations they set for students, and I'm sure we're not the only school. ""]"
20,McGill Mental Health Services -- 1st appointment,7qpsps,8,"Honestly, 
I'm just having really bad anxiety about going to the point I want to cancel my appointment bc I don't know what to expect.
If someone could explain what happened in their first (counselling?) appointment here, I'd really appreciate it so I know how to prepare myself.
Thanks in advance.","[""Hey there, please don't cancel your appointment. First of all, everything that goes on during the appointment is kept confidential, unless the counsellor has reason to believe you are at risk of self-harm (not too common) and within the legal limits of the law. \n\nGenerally, you will start off the appointment by describing what has been bothering you. perhaps your symptoms, what triggered your anxiety, what worsens it, strategies that you have attempted, how successful or futile those strategies were etc. The counsellor may also ask questions to get a general feel of your personal background, since some mental health disorders can be caused by things such as family issues or a difficult childhood. \n\nThere isn't a huge lot that can be done in just one session, but towards the end of the session the counsellor will discuss potential strategies and resources, perhaps give you handouts to fill in to keep track of your progress until the next session. You may get a referral for psychiatry if your counsellor feels that your symptoms are bad enough to warrant pharmacotherapy (antidepressants and the sort...). \n\nI really think you shouldn't be worried about preparing yourself thoroughly for the appointment. It isn't an interview. Well, it kinda is, but it should never have to be as intimidating as a job interview. Imagine that the counsellor there is a friend that you trust. The other thing is that you should not expect instant relief after one session. It often takes weeks before you start feeling better. Most importantly, do not be afraid of advocating for yourself, and always take the time to take care of yourself whenever you're having a bad day. "", ""Hey, dont cancel please.\nIronically I went today in the morning and although I was on the verge of tears explaining to this stranger my lifes troubles. It felt good to finally tell someone about it. These people know how to talk to you and understand you, they have empathy more than anyone. This is a step in the right direction and it'll make you feel less alone even if its a little bit. "", 'Your first appointment will be about 50 minutes long. They will ask you why you decided to come see them. From that point on, they\'ll ask you a bunch of different questions based on what they think might be the issue/issues. For example, I went because of bipolar/attention deficit/depression, and I sort of knew that going in, so I told them that and the rest of the appointment was them kin of going on different tangents and directions with different questions to pinpoint what your symptoms/barriers are and potential causes that might be helpful to know when they\'re trying to help you. \n\nBasically, they want to establish:\n\na) Why/how it\'s causing problems for you\n\nb) Whether you\'re a risk to yourself, which is important to rule out or recognize because intervening right away could prevent some serious events\n\nc) What the issue is and whether it\'s the same as what you think you have. For example, I didn\'t realize that attention deficit was a big problem for me until it was pointed out, so I completely missed that. You might also ""misdiagnose"" yourself. \n\nd) The specifics of how you got to be where you are in the first place. Was it a traumatic event? Chronic stress? What is the source of that stress? What support systems/resources do you have in your life?\n\n\nAfter that, you\'ll usually go in and see someone for 45 minutes every two weeks (sometimes every week or once a month depending on your needs). \n\nI\'ve been through that process a couple of times and currently see both a counsellor and a psychiatrist here at McGill, so **PLEASE feel free to PM me** if you have questions (before or after). Anonymity is often helpful.  \n\nObviously I don\'t want to share too much about my own case here either, but if you have any questions about my personal experience I\'d be happy to share more of that as well. \n\nThe only suggestions I would make are as follows:\n\n - Be as honest with them as you are comfortable with. If there\'s something that you feel is relevant, then don\'t just skip over it. If you don\'t want to mention, for example, that your sibling died of cancer and it was a long painful process that brought down your grades, social life, blah blah blah, then at least try to say ""I lost a loved one and it really impacted my life"" or something like that. If they have at least a vague idea, that really helps them. Also, if you\'re nervous or don\'t want to talk about something or share further details, then just say so, for example ""I\'ve been all stressed out about coming here"" or ""I\'d prefer not to talk about that any further"". \n\n - If they refer you to psychiatry and you get landed with Dr. Franck, you might want to ask to see someone else. \n\nAgain, fee free to message me with any questions. ', 'Dont cancel your appointment. I went because my depression got bad. Its helpful, definitely even more helpful if you straight up ask for a different person if yours isnt helping you (they wont be offended i promise!). Only thing is health services is v overstrapped so your next meeting wont be for a few weeks. Thats what got me really. I started going because I was referred from a hospital for being suicidal, and at my extreme state the best they could do was every 2 weeks then every month.  Id feel better after the meeting but having to wait a month caused a lack of progress. \n\nBut they help, really. One thing that struck me in my first meeting was being told ""you dont have to live like this"". Because you dont, and you get so used to carrying all ur shit that you dont realize that its possible to live without it. ', ""Thank you so much for taking the time and giving me such a detailed response. It means a lot and it's kind of calmed my nerves a bit to know sort of questions that'll be asked and things to write down before the appointment so I know what to mention so I don't forget that I experienced or tried something. 😊\n\nI'm sort of an over prepared type of person with everything, even when it comes to just going somewhere for fun I either need someone with me or a description of what I'm supposed to do/expect 😹😹 \n\nIt took me a long time to get the nerve to make the appointment so I'm glad that I have this response now to help me not throw it away. Good luck with your semester 💖💖💖 and thanks!"", ""Definitely second the Dr. Franck comment. Totally forgot about that. While my experience with him wasn't awful, the advice he gave was needlessly confusing."", 'If you were assigned to Dr. Franck but it turned out not to really fit, can you just go to the Mental Health reception and ask to be seen by another psychiatrist than him starting from now? \n\nIs it something they are okay with doing? ', 'Yes.']"
21,Sign the Petition: McGill Administration Continues to Fail Student Mental Health,63aiaz,30,,"['YES. thank you. I think what Healthy McGill and all other mental health initiatives strive to achieve is great, but unfortunately without the administration on our side with policies it doesn\'t help at all. \n\nLike many other McGill students, I\'ve had final exam periods with 3 exams in 36 hours, and midterm weeks where I had 5 midterms in 4 days. That is *not* okay and even with over a month of preparation, the human body can only withstand so many lengthened periods of stress, it\'s REALLY hard to do well on all of them. I had multiple breakdowns last year because of the kind of bullshit I went through. And considering how much effort I put into the situation despite  how miserable I was, I can say with confidence that ultimately the university\'s inflexible policies were responsible for this. Hearing my advisor and Healthy McGill telling me to ""sleep more"" and ""take care of myself"" in these situations only got me angry because it didn\'t change the fact that I had to cut down on my sleep and work 24/7 to get through shitty schedules because I wasn\'t allowed to have an exam deferral and I couldn\'t have any timely psychological help. ', '[deleted]', 'If one needs Mental Health services to get through university, it shows he/she is not mentally strong enough to cope with the stress that comes with being at a university. He/she deserves to be expelled or be on probation because it clearly shows incompetence. ', 'The fact that four midterms in two consecutive days is allowed is bullshit.  I ended up having to defer them because of a solid 5 days of anxiety attacks anyways.  Thanks ~~Obama~~ McGill', ""The month-long winter break is what schools south of the border get to enjoy. My friend's girlfriend (who studies in the states) was able to visit Montreal for three weeks over the Christmas break AND go on vacation in London, England, before returning to school for the Winter semester without missing any classes. "", ""so I take it you *don't* want to sign the petition.... \n\nmore seriously, there are a lot of reasons why students may need mental health care during their time at McGill, and these in no way mean that they should be expelled or put on probation.

I\'ve had friends who have lost immediate family members the week before exams, individuals who cannot get enough sleep because they stay up from the stress of not knowing if they will be able to pay tuition their next semester, international students who find it hard to adapt to certain aspects of Western culture and therefore are completely isolated in terms of friends or colleagues. Many of them still get very good grades in their classes and succeed; however, they do it at the expense of their mental health. This is not right. \n\nI hope your previous comment is a troll comment because it takes a certain kind of cruelty to look down on someone due to the possession of mental illness. Mental illness is something they had no choice over and something that often needs professional help to remedied or even mitigated. We are past the days of ""tough it out"" because we now, in many cases, have scientific data and numerous studies to demonstrate that ""toughing it out"" often leads to more severe mental and physical tolls. \n\nI cannot believe you went or are going to McGill where you are literally surrounded by literature, professors, and colleagues who are experts in these kinds of fields and yet you still act as if your ignorant opinion is better than that of the psychiatric community. You should know better. \n\nI want to make it clear that this comment isn\'t for your ego/a response to your troll bait, but more for anyone who feels bad after reading what you wrote. No one should be made to feel bad because of unchosen circumstances affecting their health.', '[interesting way to kick off the discussion](http://i.imgur.com/D9xtOpS.gif)', '[removed]', 'also you must have been freaking out about the uncertainty of the deferrals because it\'s hard to ""prove"" you\'re not doing well on time with the delay in MHS.

People get stressed all the time, if university is breaking you mentally then maybe you are not fit for it.', 'HAHAHA', 'Suggesting someone take a semester off or a reduced course load is WAY different from ""you can\'t handle it and you don\'t belong here"".\n\nThe fact is many mental illnesses tend to emerge in early adulthood.  That means that students have the double duty of exploring what works for them in terms of treatment while simultaneously trying to succeed here.  That\'s why I disagree with you- if you are intelligent enough to make it here, then the university, IMO, has a responsibility to assist you if you are afflicted by poor mental health.  In fact, according to the popular idea of stress-diathesis, the university itself could be the trigger for the illness to develop in the first place.  We should be accepting people who struggle, not say ""well you made it this far but gtfo""\n\nEDIT: also, the reality is this is most likely the most challenging and rigorous environment you\'ll ever face in your life.  We\'re not living in this fantasy world like you described, at all.', ""You wrote it better than I did. Looking back maybe I was a bit harsh with my words. However, I think it is reasonable to draw the line somewhere. If mental illness is severely impacting the student's learning, I do not see anything wrong with telling them to take a break or withdraw from school until they fix their illness which I think is the same result as probation."", ""Sure, I understand that there are extreme circumstances. It does bother me that some people are suffering from consequences that they are not responsible for. However, I don't think increasing presence of mental health treatment on campus is efficient in any way. If mental illness is as detrimental as you say, and university environment is responsible for it, why can't university encourage the student to leave and tell the student to come back after curing that illness with a medical expert? Also if this is reoccurring issue, I think university should step in and tell the student that maybe it is better to pursue other passion for the sake of university and the student. I guess people were upset at how I worded my comment, but I don't see any difference between what I just said here and probation/expulsion in terms of result."", 'She should read this.

A lot of people stop their help-seeking because it\'s such a discouraging process, they\'ve never had to self-advocate on this level before, or generally engaged in help-seeking, and often the system is so overloaded that I\'ve heard people are being told straight up if they can\'t set goals in their first session they\'re ""functional enough"", and none of that is okay, and that\'s why I signed the petition.\n\nEDIT: I\'m glad you\'re ok, also.  Keep that support system strong, and please don\'t give up on help-seeking in general, if you know you could benefit!!', 'Hats off to you for making it through that, seriously.', 'I guess the problem is conformity, since most Canadian postsecondary schools are stuck to the two semesters of September - December and January-April, with a full 4 months off in the summer. Having one school go on a totally different schedule can be very disruptive when it comes to summer employment and internships. \n\nA third approach that is used by a few schools in Europe is three trimesters of around 8-9 weeks each, with around 2-3 weeks off between each trimester.

I\'m in a much better place now because I switched to a program where the teachers and students really care about me as a person.

It is a statement that shows you know very, very little about the realities of mental illness. ', ""Ok fair. I guess treatment is the correct word to use here. Also, I don't think I said it is easy, that is why I also suggested to seek professional help. I would argue that you do not know much about me to say the last sentence but you are entitled to your own opinion."", 'When university is key to making a living wage these days, its not as simple as""encouraging"" the student to  ""pursue another passion."" For many, this is an intrinsic step to supporting themselves (as unfortunate as that is), not an example of a sport or creative pursuit.  Likewise, not everyone can just afford to drop out. Say a student drops out, and goes and gets a job as a mentally ill individual? If anything, the university is less of the ""real world"" than the job world is and reasonable accommodations should be made to help these students be well during this time. ', 'First, I would say that university is not the key to making a living wage. There are many other ways one can obtain livable income. Minimum wage per year in Canada is around 20K to 25K. Although it would be tough to have a middle class life style I still think it is very ""livable"" income and it does not require any university degree. There are plenty of jobs that don\'t require university degree which pay more than minimum wage as well. \n\nI agree that people in university are not in it for a sport or creative pursuit. However, that doesn\'t mean university is responsible for the problems of the students and are obligated to cater to the student\'s needs. I believe it is university\'s duty to prepare the students for challenging problems in the ""real world"", including problems that will break them mentally. To achieve this, it is necessary for university to have close resemblance to what the ""real world"" is like. \n\nI too wish that I can live in a Utopia where everyone can be happy and everyone can get what they want without hurting themselves or sacrificing anything important but in reality I think you will agree that this is not possible. Some people are just not cut for a lot of things. Even if it is the fault of mental illness, people should just accept the truth and look for alternative ways for their best interest, whatever that could be. So considering your example of mentally ill individual, it is very unfortunate circumstance that can happen to someone, but he/she should not expect the university fix his/her problem.\n\nIf you were offended by my wording, I would like to apologize. I see that I was too blunt that angered many people but I just wanted to get my thoughts out there. \n\nThanks and good luck with your studies.']"

","['beware of falling into the trap of ""getting over with"" requirements instead of taking an easy/enjoyable class each semester if you have the choice', ""(if you are privileged enough to have the opportunity) Don't be afraid to take a semester off. If you're struggling due to lack of motivation, chances are you won't push through it by doing the same thing over and over again. Take a semester off to find your passion and work on yourself. "", 'Sometimes the best thing to do is just to listen and not to ask too many questions to a friend who\'s going through a rough patch. However, you should still let them know that you\'re there for them if they need support, even if you\'re not entirely sure how to help. It\'s also useful to share your own experiences if you have personally had similar struggles.\n\nAnd if you\'re on the other side, being the person suffering from mental illness, it\'s really important to let one or two of your best friends know what\'s going on instead of keeping it entirely to yourself. That will ensure that someone\'s looking out for you and knows how to help/what to expect should you experience another episode. If you\'re experiencing your first ever episode, it\'s important to acknowledge that mental illness is often chronic, and even with the best therapies it takes weeks to months to see a noticeable improvement; during the recovery phase there will often be fluctuations between good and ""down"" periods and progress can be slow. \n\nI\'ve personally had issues with anxiety last year which was bad enough to require antidepressants. I\'ve not had symptoms since December, fortunately. On the other hand, I\'ve a friend who experienced her first major depressive episode during the stressful midterm season, which continued to affect her early into the summer. I found out about this coincidentally when I saw her at the pharmacy while I was refilling my own prescription. Since then I\'ve gotten to understand her struggles and my own experiences made it relatively easier to re-assure her that she\'s not alone and that there\'s always support available. At the same time it\'s important to maintain confidentiality, and hence only about two or three other friends (whom she approves of) knows the full details of what\'s going on. ', 'When I was going through a terrible time (simultaneously with my best friend) we basically lived together. To make sure the other one was eating, sleeping and studying, we would do it all together. Then, we would have sleepovers through the very difficult times to make sure we were safe. ', ""If you can't handle taking 5 classes a semester, don't do it. Summer classes exist for a reason (:"", ""remember that you can withdraw from a course past the deadline if you really need it with documentation and a good reason.\n\n don't be like me and take the biol 201 final, despite spending the entire semester mad depressed, and THUS YOU CANT DROP THE DAMN CLASS"", 'If your friend is struggling - when your friend reaches out, just listen and be present. Be cognizant of the things you say; if you don\'t know what to say, don\'t say anything. When you\'re struggling nothing feels shittier to hear than someone close to you saying ""at least you got _"" or ""why do you feel this way?"" or ""why don\'t you get a hobby?"". If you feel that you can\'t be a soundboard for your friend, reach out to your friend often and offer to go out to eat with them or to study with them, even if they say no every time; they might feel like a burden by reaching out to you.\n\nIf you are the one struggling - like others said, it is important to seek help and let your loved ones know what you\'re going through. However, although they will care and try to be there of you, some people, whether they be your parents, friends, or partner, won\'t be capable of or know how to properly support you through a tough time. Recognize that it is not their intention to belittle you or that they don\'t want to understand what you are going through; they do, they just don\'t know how. If that is the case, it\'s okay to seek other help outside of your immediate circle. Seek support from people who do know how to help (friends who have gone through similar times, Mental Health, Counselling, Peer Support Network, etc.). Don\'t neglect schoolwork and relationships, but it\'s okay to be selfish and put yourself first. You are allowed to fall apart sometimes.\n\nEdit: I can\'t recommend counselling enough. I was fortunate to have an incredible counsellor I saw for 2 years, and it was incredibly helpful for me to set apart an hour every 2 weeks to reflect on how things have been going and check in on how I\'ve been doing, even during times I didn\'t have any particular trouble in my life. During the tough times, she was an incredible source of support. I\'ve gained so much insight into myself through the 2 years. You pay for these resources, so take advantage of them. I\'ve graduated now and even though I have had my frustrations with them, I realize how lucky McGill students are to have the resources they have.', ""Make time to go out and relax, even in extremely busy periods. When surrounded by a bunch of people who are all stressing out, it's easy to fall into the same trap.\n\n"", 'Incoming students; if you require mental health care at McGill, be sure to get a referral from your doctor in order to get an appointment with mental health. You can put the fees onto your provincial health card or Blue Cross health insurance in the case of international students', 'Nightline can be VERY helpful for venting', ""I'll try to contribute:\n\nIf you need help, McGill mental health offers hour long therapy sessions with good professionals that is covered the health insurance bill. They also offer workshops and group therapy, with the group therapy being more intensive. MMH wrote on their website that 1-on-1 therapy sessions would be available less than 2 weeks apart or an instant meeting only for emergencies (suicidal thoughts, delusions, etc). However, last year there was a clusterfuck of people who wanted to use it and that two-week promise eventually rose to 3 to 3 and a half weeks between sessions, which is not enough for many people. It's also the case that your first two sessions are only meant to acquaint your case with your doctor, and the first session for a psychiatrist is the same way. That means that in the past it could take 6 weeks or so just for you to get on medication unless you were dealing with very severe problems. On the bright side, our new SSMU president has put forward a great way of dealing with this: to allow graduate psych students to take care of these introductory meetings which will allow patients to get help quicker. She also did some other good stuff but I can't seem to find that information at the moment (someone help me out).\n\nWith that said, these changes have not been tried out yet what they have to offer at MMH might not be enough for you. If you need therapy every week then sometimes the only way that you can get it is to pay out of pocket for a professional. If you can't afford it then you really need to try to be assertive with your appointments at MMH. You can call back regularly to see if something has opened up between your then and your next appointment, and it sometimes works.\n\nhappy-tips:\n\nexercise regularly. lifting weights can make you feel better and gain muscle, and cardio can help you feel better and lose weight. do scheduled breathing exercises and meditation everyday. go on basic supplements like fish oil and vitamin d or [check this sub out if you NEED to go deeper](https://www.reddit.com/r/depressionregimens/). create a sustained habit of avoiding last-minute prep and spread your work out more throughout the week. I find that it's best to stay on campus after/before your classes for awhile to get work done ON campus and to make a 'day' of your trip to campus, and this gets easier with habit. if you're in social science/humanities classes then do all the damn readings and if the prof is cool then show up at their office hours. will yourself to create a social life or [at least try to go to something that interests you](http://ssmu.mcgill.ca/clubs-services/active-student-groups/clubs/). get great sleep by staying away from blue light before bed and also by going to bed and waking up at the same time everyday."", 'So...

I'm aware that it's likely a busy time of year for the office, but what's the point of a mental health office if it doesn't quickly and readily provide help to an average student? Thankfully, there are services for those who need help immediately, but my case does not have the same urgency. Still, it took me several weeks to get the courage and motivation to approach the office, but to be told that i have to wait that long for a 1 hr consultation is really demeaning, especially when it says on their website that it usually takes only within 2 weeks for an appointment. Furthermore, group therapy and workshop sessions are often placed in the middle in the day. As a result, I can only attend very few of the sessions unless I skip a class. I don't understand why they aren't at a more convenient time.

I really don't mean to complain excessively, but 
I just feel like the mental health services shouldn't be an extension of the typical bureaucratic inefficiency that I feel like McGill often has.","[""If there's any silver lining, I've heard from a friend that once you do see a counsellor for a first appointment, it is fairly easy to follow-up, and he's seeing the counsellor every 2 weeks. McGill has subscribed to TAO (Therapist Assisted Online), an online tutorial-based therapy site where your therapist can check on your progress remotely. Theoretically, the software also allows for teleconferencing with your therapist, but McGill doesn't seem to have activated this feature.\n\nThat said, the general consensus about mental health services at many universities in Canada is that they're understaffed and oversubscribed, with the same long wait times and inefficiency, so this isn't solely a McGill problem.

I am originally from Syria and have many relatives and friends in that country. Everyone obviously knows what is going on there. 

My last 2 semesters have been hard on me mainly due to my mental health. I have lost contact with so many of my loved ones and just not knowing what might have become of them makes me depressed. Some days it is all I can think off. I am staying in Montreal just for safety over the summer. I do not know what will happen after I graduate. I don't want to go back there.

At the same time I feel very guilty, knowing I had the means to come here and escape while so many others have had a worse fate. I feel like I cheated. I don't know what to do.

I want to seek help even though I have been so reluctant at first. I find being Syrian makes people at mcgill sometimes treat me differently sometimes although it is still so much better than Syria and I have made some friends.

How can I pull myself together so it does not affect my studies next semester. I considered taking a semester off but it is not very practical so I cannot do that.  I am culturally muslim but not actually religious at all and this make me feel so guilty with all what happens in the world. I wish it would not happen.

They are extremely helpful and have helped me in the short run, but I do have a problem with the atmosphere surrounding the way counselling is done. I am aware that you have a massive amount of students that require help, but a simple idea that comes to mind is ""quality over quantity"".\n\nWhen I visited, I was told that I have a total of only 5 sessions with someone. First of all, it takes maybe 5 sessions (usually more) to even scrape the service of any psychological problem someone may be having. Second of all, this gives the service an atmosphere of ""oh, you\'re 5 sessions are up, you should be better now."" \n\nAlong with this atmosphere, I found the counselors/therapists tried to get the students to feel that they are ""better"" within a short period of time. It takes months, maybe years to feel even remotely ""better"" from a mental issue. Maybe because these professionals are not doing a private practice and and instead, are working for an institution, this is why they must push students out, efficiently. However, this creates an environment of ""get the student out the door as fast as possible."" However, like I said above, the the therapists do know what they are doing, but I am unsure if they are aware that this is happening to students. Personally, I was seeing someone regularly at Mental Health but I eventually was pushed out and was convinced that I am ready to face my mental issue, on my own, after seeing this person for maybe 2 months. Unfortunately, I was not ready and I was hit harder than ever soon after.\n\nAnyways, my experience with the mental health services at McGill was unsatisfactory. The actual counselling was helpful but the environment that come with the service creates an atmosphere that is not helpful for someone who is dealing with a serious mental problem. \n\nI do not know if this has changed in the past year and a half but since that time, I have been seeing a private practice. \n\nEdit: I noticed a part of a response that stood out to me and I feel this elaborates further on why McGill Mental Health creates this atmosphere. Quoted: ""Our vision of Mental Health Service going forward is to maintain a student-centered perspective. To do so, we will simply need to be better, faster, more innovative."" I am specifically looking at the word, ""faster"". Mental issues usually cannot be solved ""faster"". The majority of them take time and effort from the patient and therapist, time that can take months to even years. ""Innovative"" and ""better"", I agree wth, but ""faster"" is not something I would ever want from any mental health service. \n\nEdit: I changed the word regulations to something more suited.\n\n', 'Something that troubles me is that I can think of four friends of mine (and myself actually) that have sought help mental health and anxiety problems.

I don\'t have the numbers for law students but I know there\'s a similar problem there - and I\'d imagine other faculties have their own particular metal health needs as well.  Do you do offer particular services or attention to ""higher-risk"" faculties and students?\n\nI also know that the Law student association voted for an exceptional 50k$ budget last year to address mental health of law students specifically.

Surely students should not be able to just say ""I am feeling stressed"" and have any exam deferred - this is already not the case. Also, a lot of the social utility a university provides is evaluating whether people can schedule their time, handle anxiety and pressure, and learn while managing a high workload.

Please feel free to come into our service as a walk-in. You don't need to worry about a diagnosis. All you need to do is to come in with your McGill ID and your medical insurance card and we will try our best to set up an appointment. As a general tip, it is better to come in for the morning as appointments do fill up. Our walk-in hours start at 9 am, and are available Monday to Friday. \n\n- Dr. Low"", ""Hello, \n\n1)  Within a stepped care model of health-care (the model used in Quebec), typically patients are asked to consult with a general practitioner (GP) first. This could be your family doctor or it could be a doctor at a walk-in clinic. If the GP is unable to handle the case, a referral is then made to a psychiatrist (or to another specialist if the problem is non-psychological). There are several reasons to for this. First, many classes of psychiatric symptoms can also be caused by physical health conditions (ex., hypothyroidism causing depressive symptoms) and should have been ruled out before a first visit to a psychiatrist. Second, a GP may be able to treat the problem directly if it is not too complicated and this prevents an overload of cases on psychiatrists. At our clinic, depending on the particular psychiatrist, some will be more insistent on the student having been seen first by a general practitioner. Of course, if the case seems very urgent we may waive the need for a referral. \n\n2) The portal currently in development aims to provide an option to reach out to students who may be suffering but who are not comfortable to seek mental health help. Sadly, it remains the case that the majority of individuals with treatable mental health problems remain untreated. Some factors identified by researchers to explain why individuals who are suffering do not seek help include a tendency to minimize their own symptoms and a belief that their problems are not serious enough to deserve attention. The website aims to counter these beliefs by educating students about mental health and by opening up a dialogue to counter stigma. Stigma is frequently accompanied by a fear of talking about symptoms which can then prevent a real discussion of what may be a very treat-able mental illness. Even more importantly, the website aims to provide a comprehensive list of mental health resources and other similar initiatives to start people on the process of getting better.\n \nThe screening tool on the website is not a novel computer program. Rather it is a widely used and accepted questionnaire (the Patient Health Questionnaire or PHQ) already available and used in thousands of psychiatrists and psychologists offices across the world. The tool is not intended for universal screening for all students, nor is it intended to be mandatory for anyone to complete. We have simply digitized the questionnaire so that students don't have to print it out and do it by hand.  Even the guidelines for scoring the questionnaire are available online and are free to access.\n\nThe questionnaire does not offer a diagnosis or comprehensive assessment. Rather it gives very general feedback based on the results using established guidelines which are non-controversial. The results are also matched with suggestions for resources that are specifically available to McGill students, such as McGill Mental Health Service, Counselling Service, Peer Support Network and other student-run resources.  There is no severity scale that is part of the PHQ. It screens for several very common mental health problems: depression, anxiety, disordered eating and substance misuse.\n\nThank you for your question. \n\n-Dr. Low"", 'Went to the walk in clinic to get a referral and the g.p was really confused as to why I had to go see him for one ', 'Thank you for your insightful questions. Here we go!\n\n1) Based on preliminary estimates, we are anticipating almost a 10% increase in the use of our service from last year. Our numbers also indicate over a 30% increase in the use of our service over the last 5 years and the growth seems to be quite linear. This is likely due to both campaigns that increase mental health literacy and a more general increase in the number of students seeking help. \n\nOur response has been twofold. First, we have hired staff and are are offering more clinical hours than ever. For example, the week of november 17th, we were able to offer 645 appointments (almost 130 appointments a day). Second, we are concentrating on making our service as efficient as possible. To do so, we are considering using more standardized procedures, focusing on group treatments, as well as investigating e-mental health approaches. We are hoping to get ahead of the curve as demand seems likely to increase for the foreseeable future. \n\n2) Thanks for asking this question. First, the Mental Health Service has psychiatrists, so if a student has been on psychiatric medication and has a question regarding medication use, referral should be to the Mental Health Service. There are no psychiatrists working at Counselling. In general, MHS addresses more severe mental health problems that may be longstanding or have the potential to become longstanding by causing significant impairment in a student’s life. These would include major depression, chronic anxiety, bipolar disorder, psychosis/schizophrenia, eating disorders, and addictions. Both the Mental Health Service and Counselling Service offer ‘talk therapy’ by a therapist. In order for a talk therapy to be fruitful, the ‘fit’ between the student and the therapist needs be ideal and this can take a few sessions to sort out. So when a student is wishing to engage in a talk therapy, both services are available to them and the more important thing is the student-therapist fit. There are students who have both a psychiatrist overseeing their medications from Mental Health and a talk therapist from Counselling and this will vary from case to case. \n\n3) Bring the friend to a place of safety and quiet. A place that is more familiar to the person is better. Stay with them and reassure them that he/she will get the medical and psychological attention they need. Tell them the physical symptoms (rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, impending doom thoughts) will pass even though at the moment they seem insurmountable. Tell them the panic attack is not damaging their body. Tell them to take deep, long breaths and imagine a relaxing, calming setting (e.g., their comfy bedroom at home where they grew up, a vacation they when on, etc.). Allay the specific fears they have (eg. I’m going to fail, i’m going to die, i’m going xxx). Tell them this will pass and they will need to rest for at minimum half a day following.  \n\nI hope that answers everything. \n- Dr. Low', ""So I actually contacted McGill Mental Health Service and asked them to do this IAMA. When we met I suggested that the AMA should be posted at least 48 hours prior to questions being answered so that people would have time to submit question. \n\nThey haven't mentioned a time but I would suspect that you should be seeing answers to question Monday-ish?\n\nAgain the 48 hours was something I requested so if anyone has an issue with it blame me. "", 'Hello, \n\nMcGill Mental Health has experienced rapid growth in the last 5 years and we now have a larger staff than ever before. I would say one of the biggest challenges is to create standardized protocols so that services can be provided more seamlessly and evenly. To that end, we are currently re-evaluating and developing better procedures for triaging, managing of wait-lists, and assigning students to clinicians to make the service flow as efficiently as possible. \n \nEven as we face increased clinical demand, it is unlikely that our budget will increase in the near future. In essence, we are being asked to do more and more using the same resources. The only solution is change. This might mean heavier emphasis on group therapy and the use of e-mental health delivery options. We are currently reflecting on how to do this but we do want to meet the challenge head on.\n \nOur vision of Mental Health Service going forward is to maintain a student-centered perspective. To do so, we will simply need to be better, faster, more innovative. This is no small feat but we have no choice if we want to be able to face the mental health challenge of the next ten years. \n\n- Dr. Low', 'CBT is available at McGill mental health.', 'CBT is certainly available at Mental Health. Unfortunately, we are experiencing very heavy traffic at our service and the wait times for CBT can be very long (several months at this time). As such, triage staff will sometimes suggest that students seek treatment outside of the clinic rather than wait. It is a small consolation but our CBT wait-lists remain competitive with those seen in the public healthcare.\n \nWait times can certainly be frustrating. They are a big problem not just at McGill clinics but across the province. As mentioned above, the Mental Health Service is offering more clinical hours than ever before and we have consistently  grown over the last 5 years. Yet the demand continues to grow faster than our ability to offer new therapists. Innovation is the key and we will need to find new ways of delivering our services. \n- Dr. Low', ""I don't think this is an issue with regulations, it's an issue of funding. I'm sure the people who work there would agree they need more funding."", 'Hi Woozer325,\n \nThanks for the comment! Typically, students are entitled to a maximum of 16 sessions per school year at our service. However, sometimes therapists will end treatment early because they feel the therapy work has been completed.  This is up the clinical judgment of the therapist though you should feel free to seek a second opinion. You are always encouraged to be assertive and advocate for yourself. \n\nI understand your concerns and certainly there is a role for long-term psychotherapy. However,  studies show that short-term therapy (less than 16 sessions) is as effective as longer term therapy. The duration of effective therapy varies with each individual. But for the majority of patients at our service (who tend to present with depression and/or anxiety), 16 sessions is recommended according to the current evidence on talk therapies.  \n\n- Dr. Low', 'Hello, \n\nThis is a great question and one that comes up often. I would like to highlight three areas where I think the university community can make strides towards improving the mental health of its members. \n\nFirst, greater student involvement in grassroots efforts at prevention. Here I think students need to find inspiration from the recent Students in Mind conference (organized by students themselves to discuss mental health) or the efforts of the Peer Support Network. Both represent recent direct and dynamic attempts by students for students to address the stress of university life. \n\nSecond, there is the role of Student Services like Mental Health itself which in my mind is to try to expand and find creative solutions to the rising tide of anxiety we are seeing on campus. As director, I want to see our service really listen to the latest research and new models of treatment so that we can try to maximize what we do. \n\nFinally, the university administration has a role itself in shaping policies that promote a humane and mentally healthy campus. We need to move past education as solely producing future workers towards a model which sees the campus as a place of self-actualization (the whole point of higher education if you ask me). \n\nThanks for your question, \n\n- Dr. Low', ""Also, I have been to the mental health clinic and they told me that it was because of my anxiety that I'm feeling dizzy and lightheaded. Is there anything I can do to reduce these symptoms? Please, any advice would be appreciated. "", 'Hello,\n\nI am sorry to hear about what you are feeling. That sounds really unpleasant and I certainly would find it hard to experience symptoms like that. If physical causes have been ruled out, then you might want to work on reducing your anxiety. There are a variety of ways you can do so and it depends on how you would like to approach the problem. Some ways to do so would include CBT, a type of structured therapy, or talking to a psychiatrist and trying medications. If you want an approach that is a little less structured, alternatives include seeking support from the Peer Support Network or trying an evidence-based self-help book. A good book in this vein is Anxiety Free by Robert Leahy. I hope this is helpful. \n\n- Dr. Low', ""This question makes very good points. Thank you. We did not hear about the law student's initiative but we applaud it.  Our service does not currently have specific services for different student groups. We have however been approached by different faculties to establish expertise in the specific types of stresses/pressures/difficulties that their student group undergoes. We are very open to this idea and have also met with student leaders recently (at the SEAMLESS meeting). Going forward it would be ideal to establish a liasion between faculty and student representatives of the different programs of study who have the interest and commitment to reduce mental health problems. Together we can begin to develop a core knowledge/competency of what stressors their students endure and how our mental health service can do to serve their needs.\n- Dr. Low"", 'I am here! \n- Dr. Low', 'This is actually happening.

I requested that they try and submit the AMA at least 48 hours before questions were answered so that people would have time to see it and submit questions. ', ""We receive a large number of requests for notes each year and certainly this takes up a lot of our clinical hours. Currently, it is left up to the discretion of the individual psychiatrist/ therapist whether a student receives a recommendation for deferral or not. The principles used by most clinicians include: assessing whether the symptoms seem severe enough to impair academic functioning, previous history of seeking notes, and the clinician's best judgement given their experience with the student.  \n \nThe Mental Health Service will be soon aligning the policies of Counselling, Office for Students with Disabilities and Service Point in providing a standardized note for academic accommodations. The standardized note gives a recommendation by the psychiatrist/therapist and the final decision is still left with the professor/course director, which has always been the case. The standardized note is already being used at the three other services.\n\nAs a general rule, students who have problems and require the Mental Health Service and that may need academic accommodation, should establish a psychiatrist/therapist early in the year in order to be proactive.

30,"AMA - Increase to the SSMU Health Plan Fee for Mental Health Coverage (Tuesday, March 15th from 3:30PM-5:30PM)",4ackjs,25,"Hello!

We’re answering questions about the proposed increase to the SSMU Health Plan Fee for the addition of mental health (psychology) coverage. 

The SSMU Health Plan is an opt-outable insurance plan, which costs $120 per year, in which all SSMU members who are not international students are automatically enrolled. Currently this plan covers prescription drugs, health practitioners, vaccinations, diagnostic services, hospitalizations and home care, accidents and emergencies, medical equipment, and tuition insurance. However, unlike many student health plans, it does not provide coverage for psychology and psychotherapy services.

The proposed fee increase will provide students with coverage of visits with all licensed providers of psychology and clinical counselling, up to a reasonable maximum (approximately $100) per visit, and up to a $500 annual maximum.

Feel free to ask us any questions you have about the proposed increase to the plan, what the psychology coverage would look like, or questions about the plan in general. Zach and Adam will be answering your questions on **Tuesday, March 15th from 3:30 PM to 5:30 PM**!

For more information, see the [Motion Regarding the Increase of the SSMU Health Plan Fee for the Addition of Mental Health Coverage](http://ssmu.mcgill.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/11.-Motion-Increase-in-SSMU-Health-Fee-for-Addition-of-Mental-Health-Coverage.pdf). ","['Why is the maximum coverage so low? ', 'I\'m an advocate for improved mental health care on campus, but I\'m really concerned with the context in which this motion is being brought forward.  Increased mental health funding was listed under a ""whereas"" clause in the [Motion Regarding the Increase of the SSMU Membership Fee](http://ssmu.mcgill.ca/elections/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Referendum-Membership-Fee-Question.pdf), which was already voted down by the student population. It seems like  SSMU representatives are picking a specific initiative from the previous motion to put forward in hopes that it\'ll get passed this time around. IMO this is reminiscent of when Katie Larson [wanted to hold a special referendum](http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2014/03/the-lease-is-a-disaster-and-should-be-terminated/) after SSMU failed to pass a referendum question to introduce a SSMU building fee.', '1. The motion states *""WHEREAS, mental health issues on campus require further support than what is currently available from the University, with 89% of students reporting feeling overwhelmed in the last year, with 38% of students reporting feeling so depressed that it was difficult to function, 53% reporting feeling overwhelming anxiety, and finally 7% of undergraduates seriously considering suicide while at McGill""*. Where did these numbers come from - how much of the population was surveyed? Would it not be more informative to say that ""Of x students surveyed, 38% reported feeling [etc]""?\n\nI\'ll update this as I think of more questions.', 'When we reached out to ASEQ for estimates of what kind of fee increase would be required to add psychology coverage, they provided us with estimates of several different options. To give you an idea, these estimates ranged between $25 for an annual maximum of $500, to $38 for $1100 annual maximum. \n\nThough I was interested in adding coverage near the higher end of that, the respondents to our survey were overwhelmingly in favor of the lower cost (with lower coverage) option. Because we can only put a yes/no question to referendum, we decided to go ahead with the option that students appeared to want most. \n\nI would note that this was the first year in many years that a Health and Dental Review Committee has been formed. Next Council, we are bringing a motion to make this committee a permanent committee, meaning that our coverage will be reviewed every year. In our final report, which will also (hopefully) be presented next Council, we will be recommending that future Health and Dental Committees look into how often the psychology coverage is being used, whether or not SSMU members find it sufficient, and what it would cost to increase the coverage. ', 'I think that might actually be around average for a plan like that. I remember being surprised previously at how little the maximum coverage on ""very good"" plans was. Take my comment with a grain of salt though, it\'s been a while since I looked at it with any sort of depth. ', ""Hi thanks for the question!\n\nI understand the concern about this. The base fee increase campaign promised that a portion of the increased revenue would go towards mental health programming, projects, and initiatives. However, the SSMU Health Plan premiums are paid out of a restricted Health and Dental Reserve Fund (HDRF), rather than the SSMU's Operating Fund. So, even if the base fee had been increased, the SSMU would not have been able to increase health coverage without increasing the Health Plan Fee. \n\nThe psychology coverage being proposed is very different from mental health programming. It has been specifically designed to provide professional help from any licensed practitioner to alleviate the long wait times at McGill Mental Health Services for the students who need it most. Additionally, this coverage has been developed over months of consultation and work with students, elected representatives, and the ASEQ (the insurance plan provider) - this entire process began in November 2015, before the base fee increase question was even brought forward."", 'Hi thanks for your questions!\n\n> Where did these numbers come from?\n\nThis survey was conducted by McGill as a part of the 2013 National College Health Assessment. As the report cited in the Motion states, ""NCHA is a standardized instrument that has been used extensively in United States of America and has been adapted for Canadian university students.""\n\n> How much of the population was surveyed?\n\nThe report surveyed a random sample of 4,000 McGill students with a response rate of about 10%, or 354 students. This number is hardly a full representation of all 22,000 or so students at McGill however a similar number of responses is fairly regular among surveys at McGill and those conducted by the SSMU. It should be noted that both the Director of Student Health Services and the Manager of Student Assessment felt comfortable with these numbers in making their assessment.\n\nHere is the link to the report from the Motion: [Here](http://www.mcgill.ca/studenthealth/files/studenthealth/mcgill_ncha_report_dec_2014_final.pdf)', 'Central limit theorem? ', 'Thank you, Zach. ', ""Yeah, I've also been told by ASEQ that the coverage we offer is fairly standard for student health plans. \n\nHowever, one thing that causes our plan to be a little more expensive than the average student health plan is that students can opt-out of our plan without providing proof of alternative coverage. Most student health plans that ASEQ manages only allow you to opt-out or alter your coverage if you are covered by another plan (e.g. a parent's plan), and you are required to provide proof of this. \n\nOf course, the fact that our members have more flexible coverage options is great one the one hand, but on the other hand, it causes our plan to be more expensive because less people are paying into coverage that they do not need or use. \n\n"", 'The health insurance I use (employee benefits) covers up to $2000 per person per year, with the same restriction on session price as this proposal. I also have all my prescriptions covered 100%, rather than 80%. ', 'Thank you! I was under the impression that these numbers came from a SSMU-conducted survey. Is it too late for the Motion to be edited to include the clarification you just gave me?', ""I find it hard to believe that samples reached in SSMU surveys are representative of the entire student population, if engagement is anything like other interactions students have with SSMU (ie voting with only ~12% quorum that's heavily biased for and against certain demographics)."", 'Changes in coverage such as these (increasing coverage from 80% to 100% for prescription drugs) are the kinds of things that I would like future Health and Dental Committees to look into. \n\nAs I mentioned in an answer above, Adam and I formed the Health and Dental Review Committee on a trial basis this year, but before this, the plan had not been reviewed formally by a committee in a long time. At next Council, we will be moving to make this committee permanent. \n\nMy intention is that, in the future, the Health and Dental Plan Committee will continue to review our coverage and provide avenues for students to let us know what they like and do not like about our coverage. If students tell us that they would like to pay more overall for the plan, and in return get better prescription drug coverage, we would be happy to offer that!', 'Unfortunately it is too late to change the text of the Motion, but the report is cited as a clickable link, so I hope anyone uncertain about that or looking for clarification and further information will check that out.

However a [Student Experience Survey](http://ssmu.mcgill.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SSMU-Priorities-Student-Experience-Survey.pdf) conducted separately last year by SSMU, which garnered 1,053 responses, found that about 54% of students listed ""supporting student health and well-being"" as one of their top 3 priorities, with 22% of all respondents listing it as their greatest priority.', 'This discussion is now totally unrelated to the AMA, but if political polls were done over online mediums, they\'d:\n\nA) Only reflect the opinions of those who own/have access to a computer and use those sites, which is counterintuitive to representational sampling. Plus, there\'s no way to verify on social media if a voter is eligible to vote. I remember a couple days ago there was an article about how a huge amount of votes for Sanders in one online poll were discovered to have been submitted by teens too young to vote. \n\nB) Have to deal with self-selection bias (which is an issue that also may be relevant to the SSMU stats, depending on how they were obtained, but online surveys are pretty instrumental to psychological research, if the number of invitations to do them in my inbox is any indicator, haha). \n\nYes, poll-based predictions can be wrong, that\'s what confidence intervals attest to. Any kind of sampling can be ""wrong"" regardless of sample size and variables, that\'s just inherent to statistics. There\'s also lots of research into how poll results often inform voting patterns, and not the other way around. The point still stands, however, that relatively suprisingly small sample sizes are industry practice in social sciences research. ']"

I think the size of the clinic in terms of staff on all fronts (psychologists, psychiatrists, counsellors, etc) is way too modest for a clinic servicing a student body the size of McGill's. \nThis is probably pretty obvious and the harder question is how to fix this. Basically I think McGill just needs to make it a priority and invest more money into it, which is why personally I'm skeptical the current system will improve since I doubt they will. "", ""The way appointments are scheduled at counseling is horrendous. If you've never been before you have to show up from 1130-3 for a first come first serve basis. When I went after going to the clinic they had booked up by 1230. If a student is coming to get counseling they're not in the best state to begin with. To make them line up on a first come first serve basis is pretty outrageous. There should be an option once the day is booked for students to be able to reserve a spot the next day. I can't skip all my classes to line up at counseling for the hope that maybe I get to see a counselor for 15 minutes. That's doesn't help someone who needs counseling. Presumably they're already there due to missing classes and can't afford to miss class any longer. The system is broken and does not work there.\n\nAlso the fact that mental health and mcgill health don't have the proper funding or facilities to have their own building is outrageous. We have over 20 000 undergrad students and all we have for them is 2 waiting rooms in the one clinic which could fit maybe 40 people max? That's outrageous. "", 'Push them to start a project that the Alma Mater Fund can fundraiser for. If any DAR reps are there, ask them what can be done to speed this up.', 'The Mental Health clinic could avoid focusing on exam/homework stress when advertising their services. It\'s become a joke - I\'ve overheard so many conversations where people have said they got a midterm deferred by Mental Health because they hadn\'t studied. They feigned stress, etc., and ta-da! An extra week to study.  \nThere are students at McGill who need to see somebody but can\'t because the clinic is busy servicing people who have put off studying and are looking for a way out of their own mess.  \n  \nSo: get rid of the ""Are you stressed?"" (and the like) posters. They\'re not helping people, and they\'re hurting the clinic\'s reputation.  \n  \nGood luck tomorrow.', ""I had experiences with Mental Health last year that were pretty bad.  I developed major anxiety issues last year that severely inhibited my ability to do basically anything--my mind felt really cloudy and I desperately needed to see a psychiatrist.  Due to the waitlist though, I had to wait three weeks for an urgent problem, which was horrible.  When I finally got my appointment, the doctor was just really unhelpful.  It felt like I was at a drug dealer, and most of it was either him seemingly refuting the problems I was having, or asking me what I think I should do to treat myself instead of relying on his degree to point me in the right direction.  \n\nI've generally had a decent enough experience with counselling, although I will agree with /u/Not_Tom_Hanks that the intake system for appointment scheduling is ridiculous.  If someone has class around 11 AM, he/she has almost no chance at seeing a counsellor and setting up future appointments.  That's just not right.\n\nAs for solutions, I think they should definitely revise their waitlist system in some way that makes it easier to get appointments sooner (not entirely sure how, but if there was a way, it'd be a huge help).  They could also maybe refer students to trusted off campus therapists/psychiatrists to get more people help and lower the burden on the school's systems."", ""Put xanax in the water.\n\nI'm only halfway kiding."", ""I had to go to the Mental Health Service earlier this year and i had to wait 1 month for a 15 minute appointment. in total since the beginning of this semester i've probably had about 25 minutes of time with professionals and i'm no closer to getting better as a result. \n\n\nThe mcgill mental health services is frankly a joke.

37,Students in Mind - A conference about mental health on campus,2gi80a,2,"Hey everyone!

[Students in Mind](https://www.facebook.com/StudentsInMind) is a conference that will be held on October 5th at McGill and its goal is to engage students to discuss about issues regarding mental health on campus, peer support, and self-care. 

There will be speakers, panelists, and organizations from both McGill and Montreal's mental health communities, as well as workshops on self-care and peer support. 

University can takes in toll on many of us, and it can sometimes feel isolating, as though we are the only ones going through certain struggles beyond our academics. It can be especially difficult if we don't know where to go, and how to get help, especially on campus. Sometimes, it's just a matter of wanting to help out a friend, and not knowing how. 

We hope to reach a great number of students by posting on /r/mcgill to let you all know about this conference, which brings up a topic that touches us all. 

If you're interested in getting more information, you can visit our [website](http://studentsinmind.ca/)

40,Why does Mcgill Health/Mental Health suck so much,2fb9tl,5,Just wondering if any of you guys know why it's so poorly funded and run.

Followed up with a family physician during my entire degree, got physicals, and was given the referral to see a specialist.\n\nI also used the drop in clinic once, was triaged appropriately, and had a nurse help me out.

Fairly easy to deal with once you're in the system.\n\nI'll agree that booking an appointment with Health Services is annoying. The counter staff are also quite rude. \n\n"", 'Here\'s the thing- it\'s a system, and just like any other system with lots of users who have an extremely wide variety of different needs, there are rules to ensure ease of access for all.  It might be tricky to navigate through the services at first, but they can be accessed by those who need it and they do help people here.  Also, it\'s tough to address the nature of your complaint without knowing specifics (""poorly funded and run"" is a poorly argued point), and this is really not the type of thing you ask for specifics for.\n\nAnecdotally, I\'m from Ontario, and I\'ve used both services, I\'ve gone through a couple of counsellors at this point (yay interns and mat leave), some were better than others, and overall it\'s made an undeniable difference in my life for the better.\n\nTry drop in at Counselling Services if the matter is urgent- get there ASAP in the morning, because like every other walk in clinic the spots fill up early.  Otherwise, you\'ll have to ask for intake at either service, you\'ll be triaged, and placed on the waiting list.  It\'s run like any other non-private health care service; I\'ve only ever used OHIP/public health care, and the system here at McGill is no different from any other you\'ll encounter, if you don\'t have the cash to shell out for an appointment immediately.\n\nIf you don\'t feel comfortable going back, I know SSMU is establishing the Peer Support Network which provides opportunities to talk to a peer trained in active listening and such, and they do offer support services.  If Clare S-K or Courtney A are kicking around the subreddit these days, I hope they jump in because they definitely know a lot more about it than me.

42,How was your experience with the mental health services?,2xas0p,1,"Throwaway because it's kind of an embarrassing topic.

I'd appreciate it if anyone would like to share their experiences.","['Counseling services or mental health services? I have experience with both (CS for counselor/therapy, MHS for psychiatrist/meds). I don\'t think I want to go into too much detail about this. Counseling has helped, but it\'s been a slow process and you need to be willing to discuss things honestly and to make changes if you want to get any benefit out of talk therapy. Meds have helped, but it took time to find the right meds/dosage, and they are far from perfect. Please don\'t generalize too much from my experience, it\'s different for everyone. The best thing to do is to go to counseling/MHS, make an appointment, and give it a try. Don\'t expect too much and be patient. Counseling services is free, but there is a limit on the number of appointments per year. MHS should be covered by your insurance (and thus also ""free""), but if you are prescribed medication you will have to pay for it (I don\'t know how provincial healthcare handles it, but with Blue Cross you have to pay full price up front and then Blue Cross reimburses 80% of the cost).']"

To listen or get any work done, I need to take enough stimulants to wake up my slow loris ADHD brain... which kills my appetite, so I'm constantly alternating between eating nothing for long stretches and eating like a competitive eater at 10PM to make up for the reduced appetite. 

The kicker? I also have a mild form of bipolar disorder, so I rapidly cycle from short periods where I feel amazing to weeks where everything is grey. So to put it mildly, I'm an inconsistent student. 

In CEGEP, I had a counselor that I could see weekly to help me handle these mood swings. In McGill though... Good luck getting an appointment with anyone. Last time I set up an appointment, it took me a month and a half to get one... which ended up being in the middle of finals week. By then my crisis had passed, because I'd dealt with it by then. 

I'm afraid i'll have another mental breakdown this semester and permanently fuck my GPA, but I don't see any measures I can take to prevent the onset of any problems.

According to McGill, most nearby CLSCs only accept RAMQ, or at best they accept RAMQ and other provincial medicare cards (for which there is often a charge): http://www.mcgill.ca/studenthealth/see-doctor/offcampus', ""That's a great system, but we're talking about in Canada."", ""You may be right for CLSCs, as I can't find a page for information about paying out of pocket (which blue cross would then reimburse).  I know the CLSC I worked at (Benny Farm) had the ability to just take a credit card for someone who lost/doesnt have/refused to give RAMQ.  \n\nPrivate clinics are covered at 100% with the blue cross insurance, and for that I do have a source: https://www.mcgill.ca/internationalstudents/health/coverage/handbook\n\nYou may need to pay out of pocket and apply for reimbursement, but as I said, you would prefer a private clinic to a CLSC, as it is faster and less crowded.  Going back to the original point, this is why McGill doesn't need to provide a full service clinic to international students-- they can just walk to one of many private clinics downtown.  "", 'Not sure if you get it but in CANADA aka many other provinces, international students are covered by provisional healthcare. As an international student who was accepted to UofT, UofA and UBC, I had to research their provisional healthcare systems. I have a severe cough rn, and the cheapest way to resolve this is to go to mcgill health services which is not great. Several of my friends have encountered situations where they had to pay lots of money out of pocket before putting down a claim. Again, the point is that other provinces do have better approaches to this. ', "">Private clinics are covered at 100% with the blue cross insurance, and for that I do have a source: https://www.mcgill.ca/internationalstudents/health/coverage/handbook\n\nHave you actually read the handbook? Blue Cross covers 100% but *only up to the RAMQ schedule of fees*. Private clinics can charge whatever they like which is usually, unsurprisingly, more than the RAMQ fee. Just in case you're in any doubt, here's what McGill say about, it, emphasis in the original:\n\n>Please be aware that if you have **out-of-province or international student insurance, MOST** of these clinics will require you to **pay cash up-front** (you **may be partially reimbursed** by your province and/or insurance provider by submitting a claim afterwards).\n\nFor international students, the only clinic they can go to where they are guaranteed 100% insurance coverage is the McGill clinic. Out-of-province students can get treatment at *some* CLSCs, assuming they live in an area covered by a CLSC that accepts non-Quebec medicare cards, and in some cases this will involve extra fees an/or upfront payment. This is why McGill needs to be a healthcare provider.""]"
51,What kind of experiences have you guys had with the Health & Wellness Centre?,8yyjo8,4,"If you've struggled with any sort of mental health issues, has the Health & Wellness Centre been useful for you? And what are the wait times usually like?","[""I haven't used the mental health services, but for the clinic, wait times are ridiculous. Appointments open on the 15th of the month for the following month, and fill up in a few days. Drop-in fills up for the day pretty quickly, too: if you get there at 9, you might not see anyone til 3pm. And I've found the front desk people are not super friendly. The one triage nurse I saw, though (don't know if there are several) was really sweet."", ""1) McGill's mental health services are an utter joke, I'd look elsewhere for what you may need on that front.\n\n2) If the Wellness Center is anything like the medical clinic on campus, then expect to wait for several hours. Wait times for any sort of health service on campus borders on ridiculous (when I got strep in February, I spent over half a day in the waiting room - not fun)."", 'I went, saw someone, cried, she told me she didn’t have a spot for me until September (in March), i eventually became depressed and failed two classes. I dont recommend. My experience with them is aight next to some of my friends stories. There’s lots of other private or public clinics you can go to', ""Late comment but I'm not very pleased with the other comments here and I'm sure other people will have similar questions :p\n\nIf you're talking about urgent/emergency mental health issues, I don't have any experience with wait times for drop-ins. If you go to McGill Counselling Service and you're can't see someone soon enough, make use of helplines like suicide action montreal ( 1 866 277-3553 ).\n\nOn the other hand, if you're asking about less immediate support, I've been using the mental health services since early this year. I was lucky to get an initial appointment about 2 weeks after I showed up at the front desk, since I went right at the beginning of the semester. If you wait until around exam periods or later in the semester when it's really busy, you could be waiting for much longer. Afaik, right now or at the beginning of the semester would be a good time to try and book an appointment since they won't be as busy.\n\nAt your first appointment, you'll be asked to answer a questionnaire, then you'll meet with a counsellor. From there, they will determine what kind of support/plan you need that they can provide. Like any kind of therapy, it can be hit or miss since there are so many factors that can influence the sessions (your counsellor, your needs, how you communicate together, and whether they or the counselling service as a whole can provide what you need). It might work out great, or it might not work out at all.\n\nThat being said, if you do think you might need support, don't be intimidated by stories of how the service has failed people. McGill's resources are free, so it's worth a shot. Yes, the wait time can be long and it might not work out for you even if you do get followup. In that case, don't stop looking for support. If you think you need it, prioritize finding it.""]"

Having good time-management skills. Not using any performance-enhancing drugs (like Ritalin), coffee and cigarettes."" (I quote verbatim). Aside from the fact that this is a way to make light of the fact that many neurodivergent students rely on medication like Ritalin to function on a daily basis and that addiction is not something that one can just get over, the statement has further troubling elements. \n\nMany students with mental health issues, including myself, feel as though we have been routinely failed or ignored by McGill when we voice our concerns or reach out for support, and Dyens is clearly failing to ""[ensure] the best student experience"" - it really seems to be quite the contrary. It is irresponsible and quite frankly patronizing at best to suggest that we do not know that good ""hygiene de vie"" is paramount to academic success, at worst it is actively harmful... Mental illness prevents students from achieving such habits and it certainly isn\'t as simple as just overcoming it.\n\nThis brings me to the point mentioned by the McGill Daily:\n\n""During his term as DPSLL, Dyens has supervised portfolios vital to the well-being of students, particularly through Student Services, which includes Counselling and Psychiatric Services and the Office for Students with Disabilities. Between 2011 and 2016, McGill saw a 35 per cent increase in students seeking mental health services. However, over $2.5 million has been cut from Student Services’ overhead finances in the past seven years. The Stepped Care program was introduced in 2016 in response to these cuts, often pushing students in need of one-on-one therapy towards resources like online self-help literature, deemed “unlikely to be highly valuable on their own” by former McGill Mental Health Director Norman Hoffman. While Dyens claimed that Stepped Care eliminated wait list times for over 100 students, it did so by making one-on-one counselling less accessible. Students have reported being turned away from counselling for being “too high functioning” to warrant help. The most recent reforms to campus mental health services prevent students from seeing a psychiatrist unless the student has a referral from a general practitioner or a McGill counselor. Mental health care remains even less accessible for trans students, who continue to face barriers due to inadequate staff training, and for students experiencing eating disorders, whose services were recently scaled down.""\n\nStudents do not have the tools at their disposal to treat mental health issues at McGill due to these cuts, and putting the onus on students to pick up the slack when voicing our concerns is utterly outrageous.The rest of The Daily\'s article brings up many other valid criticisms of Dyens and I think it would be prudent to give it some consideration during his upcoming reappointment process. \n\nNo amount of willpower can rewire your brain or produce the neurotransmitters you are missing or replace a one-on-one psychotherapy session. Dyens seems to fundamentally misunderstand what students who struggle with their mental health need and what mental illness entails, which is not a great start to say the least. I have worked with Jack.org, a national organization of young leaders changing the way we talk about mental health, and the societal stigma associated with mental health that we work so hard to dismantle is being further perpetuated by McGill as an institution through Dyens. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my email, I hope to hear back.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Name redacted]""\n\n\n\n**I also linked the articles but they were hyperlinks so they didn\'t copy pasta very well, lol**', 'My issue is that this speaks to his wider understanding of mental health and mental illness.

Not sure that removing breaks from high-stress periods would help.  \n  \nI can't blame him for dismissing the explanations. Every spring break of my undergrad was spent working on projects that profs assigned knowing we'd have extra time. Not much relaxing there.  \n  \nMental health and mental illness are two different things, let's not confuse the two. The former is maintained by healthy habits, the latter as a medical problem. Access to psych services would not help the majority of students. The Ritalin comment seemed more about drug abuse than regular usage.  \n  \nLet's not pretend that students are particularly well-balanced, either. There's a reason why the library fills up near midterms and finals, and it's not because people have been keeping up with the work. That said, it's also not a reason to deny a fall break.

53,November McGill Senators AMA,7f0aml,9,"Hey everyone! We’re the SSMU senators for this year, back to answer your questions about McGill policies, especially the academic ones. 

As SSMU senators, we currently sit at McGill senate (monthly), along with seats on various McGill committees. For the Month of November, we want to highlight some topics going to Senate today, Thursday November 23rd for discussion: 

The *McGill Wellness Strategy* is being developed by Student Services to improve mental health on campus. The strategy aims to improve physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health as they are all components to maintaining health overall! The passing of this strategy will lead to a new office under the University’s Provost, and appointed staff who would help different units develop their own policies and practices that foster overall wellness in their smaller community.
 
The *McGill Context* is being revised in order to inform the revisions happening for the Code of Student Conduct this year. It dictates which situations the code can apply to. The revisions widen the scope of the policy from covering McGill sponsored events and incidents on campus, to off campus violations that compromise the well-being or success of community members as well.  

The *McGill Climate and Sustainability Action Plan* highlights the future short-term goals and steps towards the university's long-term goal of carbon neutrality. Current emission rates are discussed. The University outlines 22 priority actions on achieving their short term climate and sustainability goals over the next 3 years. 

The *Annual Report of the Committee on Enrollment and Student Affairs* highlights multiple changes in the faculty of continuing studies. GPA requirements are officially set at 3.0 over 4 years or over a 3.2 in your last 2. Dental aptitude test requirement was also approved for the faculty of dentistry.

EDIT: See you next semester, we're out! 
","['What are your thoughts on the recent [q&a](http://archive.is/sCq7J) with Ollivier Dyens in the McGill Reporter?', ""Would the new office proposed in your Wellness initiative be working under Dep Prov SLL? If not, how would that office's duties overlap with those currently given to the DPSLL?"", 'Back when I worked at the McGill Alumni Phonathon, I remember fundraising for specific mental health initiatives for the Faculty of Medicine.  One graduate gave a significant donation and told me a story as to why he is donating so much:\n\nWhile this alum was doing an MDCM at McGill, his best friend struggled with mental health issues, culminating in him believing that he made an error that lead to the death of a patient.  The friend went on to commit suicide.  At the time there were no specific mental health services for MD students, so this alum donated a substantial amount to the current project to fund MD mental health services.\n\nI have long felt that there is an uncomfortably high chance that the work-until-you-die culture on this campus could contribute to the suicide of a student.  With all of this context I have these questions:\n\n1. Has the McGill Senate discussed the possibility that McGill Counseling Mental Health Service was changed for the worse in recent years?  \n\n2. Do McGill Student Senators feel that appropriate priority is being placed by McGill on funding mental health services in the context of budget cuts from the Quebec government?  \n\n3. To what extent is this issue unfixable by McGill without additional funding (perhaps RAMQ-funded counseling) from the Canadian and Quebec governments?\n4. Has McGill considered enabling the Faculty of Medicine to hire counselors specialized in treating healthcare professionals and allowing students from Medicine, Nursing, Social Work, and PTOT to access these services?', ""Can you comment on what's going on at SSMU from your perspective, especially in light of the administration's visit to SSMU council to express their concern over lack of constitutional clarity/institutional wellness/etc? "", 'Drag him for filth!', 'Our thoughts!:\nIsabelle: Thank you for your question! The q&a brings up a lot of points in terms of more administrative barriers to implementing a fall break. The question on mitigating mental health challenges without a fall break has interesting suggestions, and these will be things that some students practice in order to be well. People have pointed out, and we agree, that the advice given isn’t a blanket solution to mental health issues on campus, and that students have different needs in terms of adequate support.\n\nJed: There needs to be recognition that dealing with mental health issues isn’t simply a matter of effort and it is concerning that the administrator in charge of overseeing student services would make a statement along those lines. McGill’s mental health strategy will never be effective if it stigmatizes and blames people struggling with mental health issues. \n\nAhmer: I recognize that there are multiple administrative barriers in the implementation of a fall reading break, but students have repeatedly expressed their desire for this knowing the trade offs (based off 2015 survey). If the university is dedicated to the health of its students, those wishes should carry more weight. \n', 'Hey! Thank you for your question!\nIsabelle: This office would be working under the Provost’s office (so under a bureaucratic position one step higher than the Deputy Provost), because the strategy is supposed to apply to the entire campus instead of just units that work with students. It’s supposed to support units on campus to develop their own unit-specific strategy so this means that student services and all the other units under SLL will have to develop their own strategy as to how they will foster overall wellness in their unit. There will be overlap in terms of developing multiple wellness strategies but less overlap in terms of scope! \n', '1. \nNahal: Mental Health Service was discussed at Senate on Thursday and the verbal report provided by Oliver Dyens & Martine Gauthier (Director of Student Services) showed positive changes so far. According to the statistics provided, there was a 50% increase in mental health services at McGill thus, accommodations had to be made. So far, McGill has added more psychiatrists, clinicians, and caseworkers and will be implementing a more formal triage system (kind of like ER at hospitals). Also, we have more professionals comparatively to other institutions. Finally, the report on Thursday also showed a decrease in average wait time from about 4 months to 4 weeks and future plan is to create a framework that allows students to have access to the services on the same day. From these stats, I think we are moving in a positive direction! \nAhmer: This is a difficult issue, and there has been some disagreement on  best how to allocate resources and organize health services. Though there has been investment, and some positive indicators, we will have to see how effective this will be. \n\n2. Fatima: As Nahal mentioned above, there was information provided during yesterday’s senate to show that work is being done and money invested keeping mental health services in mind. Senate provides oversight on the budget and we can advocate for more money to be put towards mental health\nAhmer: Student Services is funded from student fees and is less impacted by budget cuts from the government. I would say that McGill is definitely prioritizing mental health to try and deal with the increased demand for services. There was a recent investment from the Rossy Foundation of approximately 1 million dollars that is being put towards health services and mental health. Though once again, the effectiveness of the exact approach can be debated.\n\n3. \nAhmer: Difficult to say. All campuses across North America are struggling to cope with increased demand for mental health services. There’s a limit to how many services the University itself can sustainably provide, and it’s unclear whether the problem simply requires more funding. Discussions are underway to provide better connections with services off campus to help deal with the burden. Additional government provided/funded services off campus would ease the burden, but is likely outside the scope of the University.  \n\n4. \nAhmer: The Faculty of Medicine currently does have the WELL Office (https://www.mcgill.ca/thewelloffice/well-office-homepage) which provides support and counseling for students working in health professions, catering specifically to their needs and schedules, in recognition of the challenges they face. \nNahal: I am in my last year of nursing and before I became a senator, I am going to be honest, I definitely did not know about WELL Office. I only found this out recently, which means that majority of health care professional schools might not even know it exists. I think the main problem here is communication; students should be conveyed in the beginning of the year for example, about the resources that are available to to them. \n', 'thank you so much yall']"
54,Hi everyone! Im Muna Tojiboeva and I am running for SSMU President AMA,5yofjb,35,"Hey everyone! ***thanks for everyone who tuned in to my AMA, the AMA is now over and thanks to everyone who sent me questions!***

My questions are regarding your platform points of democratic and financial accountability. What do you aim to do as SSMU President to:\n1) Address the discrepancy that exists within the reporting of financial transactions for services and ISGs, while making financial documentation more detailed to increase transparency. \n2) According to [the 2016-2017 Budget](http://ssmu.mcgill.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Global-Budget-2016-2017.pdf):\n\n""Administrative expenses are, by far, the largest section of the Operating Budget. This category includes items\nsuch as salaries for the permanent staff that assist with the administration of the Society (e.g. accountants, IT\nsupport staff), student staff salaries, bank charges, legal fees, auditor fees, insurance fees, and office supplies\ncosts. These types of costs are reflected in General Administration (Dept. 3021). This section also includes IT\n(Dept. 2000), and Executive Administrative Departments, which primarily include telephone costs, printing\ncosts, and student staff salaries.\nThe Society’s total administrative expenses are around $1.5M per year. This can be roughly divided into\npermanent staff salaries (72.6%); student staff salaries (9.1%); IT costs (2.3%); professional, legal, and\ninsurance fees (9.5%); and printing, office supplies, postage, telephones, photocopying, automobile, and\nbank fees expenses (6.5%).\nFrom 2015-2016, the total net administration expenses have increased by approximately $130K. However, a\nlarge part of this increase (approx. $80K) was due to salaries shifting from non-administrative departments\ninto General Administration due to operational restructuring. Thus, the “real” increase in expenses to the\nSociety coming from the administration departments is closer to $50K. It is also worth noting that around\n30%-50% of this $50K increase can be attributed to inflation.""\n\nHow do you plan on working with the VP Finance to stop the obscure tradition of reporting General Administration as a $1.3M budget line item without reporting on specific salaries, legal and consulting fees, and etc?\n\nThank you in advance for your answers.', 'Hey! Thanks for your question. I recognize that trust in SSMU is at an all-time low, and I completely agree that there needs to be systemic change to make SSMU more about students. I believe the role of SSMU, primarily, is to provide services to students effectively. Currently, many SSMU services are underfunded and underdeveloped, as mismanagement of funds diverts necessary resources from the key services that need it most. To that end, one of the cornerstones of my platform is revitalizing mental health services by using the services of qualified McGill graduate and medical students, creating a budget allocation for mental health services, and focusing the President’s research budget on mental health capacity. I will also focus generally, as my number one priority, on increasing the range of student services offered. \n\nIn terms of the second part of your question, I believe I can effectively represent all McGill students. I think my platform focuses on key principles that matter to all students, like mental health, making SSMU accountable to the average student, and ensuring a separation of powers within SSMU that provides more channels for students to have their voices heard. Returning the focus of SSMU to serving students is something I think the vast majority of McGill students believe should happen. \n', 'Hey, thank you for such a pertinent question – especially pressing at this time. If a student disclosed to me that one of the SSMU executive committee members had sexually assaulted a student, I would immediately take action: I think in light of recent events, it is unfortunately clear that the current SSMU executive is characterized by passivity and inaction. If an allegation is brought to my attention, I would immediately report the incident to SSMU’s Human Resources staff, help the student file a complaint with the SSMU Equity Committee if they wanted, as well as a complaint with McGill (given the power dynamic between executives and constituents, situations such as these are very much in a McGill context). While the investigation is underway, the executive in question will be suspended from their role. Following the outcome of the investigation, the executive in question will either be reinstated or asked to resign. \n\nIf the student who came forward is the victim, the most important thing to do is to make sure that their needs are met. First, I would take the necessary steps to ensure the anonymity of the victim. Second, I would utilize the necessary resources to ensure that the student accesses the necessary support resources (such as SACOMSS, CIRCLES, a community response and resource, Peer Support Centre, The Montréal Sexual Assault Centre, and Office for Sexual Violence, Response, Support, and Education). Finally, I would make sure that the person in question’s claim is addressed professionally, speedily, and adequately. \n\nI hope this answers your question!\n', 'this is a really good question', '\nHey! Thanks so much for your question! \nIf elected, as President, I would increase accountability on three fronts: \n(1) Democratic Accountability: currently, minutes for the Board of Directors meetings are not available online. Board of Directors meetings are often secretive and many discussions are had in confidential session. If we, as students, cannot access those minutes and see how our executives are acting: how are we supposed to hold them accountable? So I will mandate that minutes from any SSMU governance body be posted on the SSMU website within 48 hours. Additionally, I will make all Executives send a report to the VP Internal each week, to be included in the weekly communication from the SSMU to the membership as a means of increasing engagement.\n (2) Financial Accountability: (a) I will work with the VP Finance to hire students for about three to four hours a week for the purpose of itemizing all SSMU transactions and expenditures, and posting them on the SSMU website. Currently, over a million dollars falls into the “General Operating Budget” with no other explanations given. I will change this. ; \n(b) I will also create an ad hoc financial management committee to better hold SSMU accountable. \nThis will increase transparency and help members hold the Executive to account in terms of where their fees are going. \nHope it answers your question! \n', 'Hey!

I have experienced the inefficiencies of the Mental Health services at McGill first hand and this is one of the reasons why I decided to make it one of the cornerstones of my platform. I think it is a struggle for a lot of students and should be the number one priority not only for SSMU but for the McGill administration as well. As such, I will not only push for the improvement of mental health services within SSMU but advocate for the increase in the infrastructure of Mental Health and Counseling at the Board of Governors. \n\nCurrently, SSMU dedicates $0 to the provision of mental health services. A $0.40 opt-outable fee per student exists but this is obviously not enough. I think more money needs to go into researching best practices as well as increasing the funding of student services such as the Peer Support Centre and the Nightline.   \n\nI also would like to utilize the services of graduate students and medical students in order to be able to quickly do initial assessments in order to assign urgent cases to counselors promptly. A lot of people get turned away from the mental health services, no matter how urgent their situation is. An improved triage area would ensure that no urgent cases have been missed. Additionally, I think it is really important to streamline the relationship between mental health services and the Peer Support Centre (Mental Health services often do not refer to the Peer Support Centre like they are supposed to).  \n\nThanks again for your question! \n', 'Hi, great question! This question has been asked since time immemorial, and is as important today as ever. As SSMU President, I sit on the Board of Governors, and thus have a direct line to the McGill Administration. I would definitely explore what could be done to open the doors, as shaving ten seconds off the trudge to McLennan can definitely add up- 15 seconds times 80 lecture + exam days is 20 minutes, and who couldn’t use an extra 20 minutes to cram for finals! However, judging by previous attempts at this seemingly impossible feat, we will likely need a SSMU d’état to get the doors working again!', 'Good question, this is my single-issue vote if someone addresses this', 'Thanks for your excellent question! I believe that SSMU’s purpose is to provide vital student services, such as mental health, clubs, and SACOMMS, and focus on making the student experience at McGill better. For the second part of your question, quite frankly, after seeing how its been run for the past few years, like many students I too have questioned SSMU’s validity. That’s why I’m running. I believe I can create systemic change in SSMU to make it an organization that is not a detriment to the McGill community, but rather an asset, by focussing on student services.', 'Hi,\nThank you for your question! I believe that SSMU should focus its energy on providing student services. SSMU has definitely become over-political in recent years and necessary resources have not been concentrated on student services. For example, a significant amount of money was spent by SSMU on legal advise related to the Igor Sadikov situation. This advise was then ignored by the Board of Directors, costing student money that could’ve been spent on vital student services, such as mental health, which is a cornerstone of my platform. It is important to return SSMU’s main focus to providing the services students need.', 'There are some good things in your answer, notably referring the complainant to SSMU\'s Human Resources staff and McGill.\n\nBut several suggestions you make are deeply concerning.\n\nThere are several problems with involving the Equity Committee.  First, it is not within the mandate of the Equity Committee to address complaints of sexual assault.  The mandate of the Equity Committee is to address ""harassment or discrimination"" against ""groups that have been historically and culturally disadvantaged.""\n\nSecond, the Equity complaint process involves an investigator making a recommendation for disciplinary action to SSMU Council.  There is a serious problems with using this process for an allegation of sexual assault. A political body will be making decisions in cases of alleged sexual assault on the part of political officers.  Such a situation creates the potential for bias in the decision-making process.\n\nFinally, let\'s not forget that the Equity Committee complaints process has been widely criticized by students in the past [http://www.mcgilltribune.com/news/equity-policy-could-face-revision-following-farnan-gate-backlash/ http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/mcgill-faces-massive-backlash-after-ridiculous-apology-for-microaggression-over-emailed-joke-obama-clip].\n\nIn addition, you state, ""[w]hile the investigation is underway, the executive in question will be suspended from their role.""  Do you really think that an executive should be suspended from office on the basis of a single, unsubstantiated allegation prior to any investigation?  Should the executive be given a chance to respond prior to a decision being made about suspension?  Should an assessment be made about whether there is prima facie evidence to support the claim prior to the suspension?  Recall that these investigations may last for weeks or months, so a suspension could severely affect the functionality of SSMU.\n\nFinally, you state, ""I would take the necessary steps to ensure the anonymity of the victim.""  Do you mean that you support bringing disciplinary actions on the basis of anonymous accusations of sexual assault, where the accuser does not even identify himself/herself?  Do you favor suspending or removing executives on the basis of anonymous statements?', 'Thanks for your answer!', ""With respect, Muna, your answer to this question demonstrates significant ignorance.\n\nFirst, there is no need to explore what could be done to reopen the door since it is already known.  The doors are closed because it would cost McGill $210,000 per year to post a full-time security agent during opening hours and the libraries cannot afford it [http://www.mcgill.ca/library/node/8423].  SSMU could reopen the doors by using its Library Improvement Fund to pay this cost but has chosen to spend the money on other projects it considers more important.\n\nSecond, the Board of Governors is only involved in high-level governance, not in the administration of things like which doors are open.  Moreover, there is only a single member of the McGill Administration on the Board, so sitting on the Board is not a direct line to the administration.  SSMU's direct line comes from the administration's recognition of SSMU as the official body representing students and their willingness (especially the DPSLL's) to meet regularly with SSMU leaders to discuss issues of common concern.  Almost literally nothing SSMU has ever successfully advocated to change at McGill has happened through the Board of Governors."", 'I agree SSMU should be more focused on student services. It disappoints me when I see a lot of SSMU\'s efforts going to establishing impotent stances on various geopolitical issues, whether I agree with the stance or not. Any motion with ""commitment"" or ""solidarity"" makes me cringe. For example, despite agreeing with the principle behind the recent ""Ratification of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals"" I voted against it. I see this (solitary) question in the Winter GA as SSMU playing Model UN and patting themselves on the back with student money.\n\nDo you see this as a problem and will you do anything to encourage motions with more substance and direct relevance to McGill students?', ""I wish more folks would see this. So many people are disengaged from SSMU that too often, a politicized, extreme, but small group of students gets a magnified power within the organization. It's time to make SSMU student focused."", ""LOL that's not how anonymity works. If a complaint is brought forward, the identity of the survivor is known to the President, but ensuring the anonymity of the survivor in the public eye is widely recognized as best practice and an important measure to ensure they are not on the receiving end of any backlash. Obviously any accusation needs to be taken seriously, allowing executives who have evidence of sexual assault against them to stay in power allows them to continue to use their power to perpetuate violence. "", '> The doors are closed because it would cost McGill $210,000 per year to post a full-time security agent during opening hours and the libraries cannot afford it\n\nDespite the fact that the question and answer are both jokes...\n\nThere are many doors at McGill that do not have security guards. Why does this entrance to this library need a security guard? Whenever the Redpath doors come up on this sub the response is always about the cost of a security guard, but nobody is ever able to explain why a guard is necessary in the first place.', ""You're conflating anonymity with confidentiality.\n\nI'd like to know whether Muna believes that the identity of the complainant should be made known to the accused as part of the process or whether the complainant should remain anonymous.\n\nAs for suspension, the question is whether a single uncorroborated claim should lead to immediate suspension."", 'Hey, \n\nThank you for your remarks. I will handle each case on a case by case basis and respect the wishes of the survivors. ', ""Thank you for taking the time to respond.\n\nTo be clear, your position is that an executive accused of sexual assault should not be told during the investigation who is making the accusation if that is what the survivor wishes, correct?\n\nThe right to a fair hearing includes the right to know the case put against the accused and the right to answer that case.  How could a hearing be fair if the accused doesn't even know who is claiming to be the victim?""]"

Don't forget to [cast your vote](https://ssmu.simplyvoting.com/) from March 16-18!","['What are the main differences between your campaign and your opponents?', 'what will you do to incite SSMU drama?', ""Hey everyone! Thank you all so so much for taking to time to write all of these lovely questions! I'm sorry I can't stay to answer more, but I am a student and do need to do some work tonight.\nI look forward to answering more of your questions on my facebook page (attached above in the description), and am excited to serve as your next SSMU president.\n\nHave a great night everyone!\n\nBen"", 'Hi Ben,\n\nThanks for doing this AMA. I have a few questions for you:\n\n1. Would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses, or 1 horse-sized duck?*\n\n2. Should SSMU maintain its support for Demilitarize McGill in light of their ""call to action"" to vandalize university structures and monuments as an act of protest?\n\n4. The recent BDS motion generated significant controversy at McGill. There was hateful rhetoric and misrepresentation of both sides, as I am sure you are aware. McGill Principal Suzanne Fortier even sent out an email condemning the BDS movement. One of the concerns addressed by both her email and the No campaign was the proposal to sever ties with Israeli universities. Do you feel that severing ties with any university (not just those condemned by the BDS movement) can be an effective solution? To what extent do you think any such severance should be executed, if at all? What would happen (in your hypothetical scenario) to any McGill researchers still collaborating with researchers in those universities? Can we stand to improve the situation by making use of our ties with such universities to work with them in promoting peaceful solutions of mutual academic benefit?\n\n2. Who\'s your favorite pornstar?\n\n5. One of the concerns raised in the decision to hire a 7th executive is that the workload was too much for 6 people to bear. However, you have proposed a reduction in the amount of signatures required for student-run referenda with the goal of increasing ""grassroots change"". Do you feel that this decrease in signatures could negate the benefits of having a 7th executive? Could students become *too* involved, to the point that the executive gets overwhelmed with potentially banal motions?\n\n6. I see your proposed deficits in the budget as a sort of ""punishment"" towards students who voted no to the fee increase, as you state that it will ""eats [sic] a small amount into many different funds the SSMU has (the library fund, etc.)"". Punishment can be used to reinforce behavioral changes, but why do you feel that this is the best option? Is SSMU going into austerity mode in the the coming year? (how ironic)\n\n7. What do you consider your greatest successes and greatest failures during your time at McGill?\n\n8. A lot of students in the life science majors have a certain mentality - get good grades, get into med school (or a Masters program), do undergraduate research, and not get involved in frivolous SSMU politics. How will you reach out to these students? What ""grassroots change"" can your presidency accomplish that will inform such students of the importance of SSMU?\n\n7. What do you plan to do after your degree?\n\n*Traditional reddit AMA question\n\n**Traditional /r/mcgill AMA question', 'Dear Ben,\n\nThanks for taking the time to do this AMA. My question is mainly about your desire to reform SSMU and builds off Jermark\'s question on facebook.\n\nYou talk about past grassroots led change you have lead, could you give more examples when you have fulfilled or substantive divisive issues?\n\nLastly, you write ""not as an insider SSMU executive, councilor, or senator"" but your language (framing things in safe space vocab) and divisive opinions on the BDS motion all of which affect your ability to form a broad grassroots movement. \n\n\nMuch of what people deride in SSMU  ARE things like BDS and safe space monotone. \n\n\nSo I guess to wrap this all up in one question, you talk about your ability to form grassroot and wide coalitions, but when have you reached out past SSMU and had to grapple with those viewpoints? It seems you live within the SSMU house more than out.\n \nand thanks for taking the time out your day to answer this! \n\n\noh as Jordan answered a similar question I just thought I\'d post it here if you wanted to respond. Dont feel obligated to: \n\n""""The bonds of trust have been broken. SSMU-tocrats have a tendency of pledging campaigns in the interest of the entire student body, then continuously valuing self-interest over collective interest. I’ve been willing to take personal criticism to advocate for students typically neglected by SSMU.""""\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/4a6jva/jordan_sinder_for_ssmu_president_unite_mcgill_ama/d10aeug', 'Ben,\n\nFrom the conversation surrounding your campaign, as well as your article ""Alone in Crowded Rooms: A personal struggle with depression"", it is apparent that mental health is a main priority of yours, which is a welcome change in the conversation surrounding student politics. However, I personally had some concerns regarding the timing of your article as well as some of the language within the article itself. Seeing as the release of your article ""Alone in Crowded Rooms: A personal struggle with depression"" coincided with your announcement to run for president by several weeks, it seems a bit opportunistic; almost as if it was seen as a chance to get your name in the public arena. What I find particularly concerning about this possibility is: in claiming to empathize with those marginalized by their mental illness, as you yourself suffer from depression, you really are using the suffering of others as political leverage for your own gain. Additionally, what further concerns me is that the narrative throughout that particular article portrays yourself as somewhat of a ""hurting-hero"" - a casting that, as someone who has struggled with suicidal tendencies for the majority of their adult life, I find personally insulting. However, in all fairness to you, I have no doubt that these things truly are a coincidence and that any off-putting rhetoric was unintentional. My question to you is, in what areas do you think mental health support on campus could be improved, and in what areas does the current system lack the capacity to properly process those in need? ', 'Hey Ben, what is our plan if Trashy Spice gets elected?', 'Ben, during the press debates you waffled a bit on whether or not you support the SSMU Constitutional ""Ammendment"" 13.2 + 13.3 which would restrict what motions can be adopted on the grounds that they are ""external and divisive.""\n\nI am not at all a supporter of Jordan\'s campaign, but I cannot vote for you in good faith until I have a solid answer: As president, what would you do if this motion is passed? Do you agree that SSMU council and GA\'s need to be focused entirely on issues that are internal to McGill that are not ""divisive?""\n\n', 'What is your history of involvement with Divest Mcgill, do you still support their efforts, and if so, what do you think are the most compelling arguments for divestment?', 'Hey Ben, thanks for doing the AMA! \n\nWhich character do you main in Super Smash Bros Melee for the Nintendo GameCube?', 'Samosas or Churros?', 'How will you make SSMU great again?', 'Hey Ben! Rather tough question. Which would you rather? \nKittens or Puppies. \n                           ', ""Hahahaha we're working on stopping that - sorry!"", ""Hey CatanOverlord! I just want to quickly say that your reputation proceeds you haha, I've heard all about some of these questions. Let me try to address then!\n\n1.Without a doubt 100 duck sized horses. Have you ever tried to fight a horse? That would be a terrible idea. A horse sized duck would just be that but WAY worse.\n\n2. Demilitarize McGill largely falls under the external portfolio so deciding on how we will proceed in light of that knowledge will be something for the external, in consultation with the rest of the executive team, to discuss. I encourage you to ask the question to you're current external candidate though! Here's a link to David's event page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/1061772407198129/\n\n3. So first of all, before answering you question, I'd like to clarify that as a presidential candidate who is suppose to be representative of the student body and it's mandates, I recognize that the BDS has currently been shut down during online ratification, and thus will not be acting on its behalf as an executive.\n\nIn regards to cutting ties with universities, the BDS Action Network, as well as the motion they brought forward, never explicitly said they wanted to cut ties with Israeli universities. I recognize that issue is far more complex than any answer I can give you here, but I absolutely understand the real concerns students have brought forward surrounding rhetoric used on both sides of the BDS campaign. With these sorts of hyper-complex issues I would much rather leave the decision to the student body to decide the mandate of the president, no matter what is passed I will act as an representative of the student body.\n\n4. ______ _____ LETS PLAY HANGMAN\n\n5. I'm not sure I understand the question. Student-run referenda let students bring forward a motion to be voted on by the student body, so if you're asking about a hypothetical situation where students just start mandating the executives to do tons of things, those motions would still have to be passed by the rest of campus. Whatever is then passed is the job of the SSMU to do, but there are many more people than just executives to delegate to; in fact many of those student-run referenda mandate councillors, or senators to do something rather than executives.\n\nTD;DR No, I am not concerned with this and look forward to the student initiatives that are brought forward! :)\n\n6. Just to clarify this is not a punishment at all, and that was only one of the budgets that I was giving as an option. The deficit budget would allow the student union more time to work on the issue, and it would in no way have direct impacts on the student body. In any case, all the budgets (break-even with cuts to services/staff/etc, and the two deficit budgets) I plan on publishing in the papers for student feedback before anything is passed. Haha I promise there is no internal austerity currently planned!\n\n7. I think my greatest success since coming to McGill actually doesn't really have anything to do with the SSMU. As a student, last summer I lost a lot of people close to me in a very short period of time and found myself depressed, but after months of working my way out I finally did. In a final effort to close that chapter on my life entirely I wrote an article, trying to own a part of my life that was largely debilitating and turn it into a resource for others. If you want to check it out I attach put the link here!\n\nhttp://www.mcgilltribune.com/alone-crowded-room-personal-struggle-depression/\n\nMy greatest failure since coming here has definitely been the lack of time I've been able to give my direct and extended family. As someone who grew up with a lot of support from the community around me I value family more than most things, and have the strong believe that family is much more than who shares your blood. I have done what I can to give my parents, brother, and nephews the time they deserve but it's been tough. Not only that but I leave behind a self-defined little brother (Sam), and sister (Mallory) that I think about every day and wish I could be with more often. If they are reading this somehow, love you both!!!!!\n\n8. It's no secret our student body is very disenchanted with the way SSMU works right now. A floor fellow recently posted on my wall as well talking about how first year students, only a couple months in, have already started to develop negative opinions on the SSMU, so it's not surprising to me to hear that Life Science students may find themselves not wanting to get involved.\n\nThis problem is a very layered one, that can start to be helped with the first year outreach program (FYOP) that I purpose in my platform, that helps encourage students to get involved from the beginning of our careers. But there is so much more we can do.\n\nI would like to quickly clarify that I think the SSMU executives this year did and amazing job, and were probably one of the most competent exec groups we've seen in a long time, but they were understaffed and less-than-present on our campus. Making sure, as an executive, that myself, as well as the rest of the office, are doing everything we can to come out to student/student group-run events (such as Life Science events) to engage with the student body and let them know how to work with SSMU to improve their experience I think will make a massive difference. I plan on being a very visible and supportive president during my term.\n\nNot only this but looking into more ways in which we can keep the student body engaged and involved in the SSMU through media outlets will be important. A (very rough) idea that I've brought up was looking into using some of the tv's located all over campus, that currently just show the McGill logo all day every day, to display what is happening in SSMU instead. These TV's could show how you can get involved, recent achievements by students, and more.\n\n9. TBH I don't really know yet! I wrote my LSAT last summer incase that's something that I want to pursue, but I've been pretty involved since my 12th year of high school and am kind of excited to take some time of. Who know, maybe I'll even travel a little :)"", '> I see your proposed deficits in the budget as a sort of ""punishment"" towards students who voted no to the fee increase, as you state that it will ""eats [sic] a small amount into many different funds the SSMU has (the library fund, etc.)"". Punishment can be used to reinforce behavioral changes, but why do you feel that this is the best option? Is SSMU going into austerity mode in the the coming year? (how ironic)\n\nI\'d just like to clarify something: the SSMU is not able to use restricted fees for anything other than the purpose for which they were intended. In other words, we would not be able to take money out of the Library Improvement Fund, or any other fund, to cover operating deficits. \n\nI will reiterate what I\'ve said repeatedly at Council, which is that I plan to present a break even budget for 2016-2017 in April, which will result in significant cuts to many areas of the budget. The only way I would consider presenting a deficit budget for 2016-2017 would be if it was accompanied by a (realistic) plan to balance the budget in a relatively short period of time (i.e., quickly enough that we would not dip into our capital reserves to a degree that would be detrimental to the financial sustainability of the Society). \n', '> You talk about past grassroots led change you have lead, could you give more examples when you have fulfilled or substantive divisive issues?\n> Lastly, you write ""not as an insider SSMU executive, councilor, or senator"" but your language (framing things in safe space vocab) and divisive opinions on the BDS motion all of which affect your ability to form a broad grassroots movement.\n\nHey, thanks for the question!\n\nIn regards to you\'re inquiry as to what grassroots change I\'ve done in the past, the two largest things I\'m proud of would be petitioning the SSMU to create a new student position on SSMU council for Environment students, and to lower the amount of signatures required for a student to bring forward a referendum from 500 to 100.\n\nAs a student who has gone through the process of getting signatures, I can personally attest to it being a massive hindrance in student led change. As well, being a student - not a council, senator, or executive - leading this sort of grassroots change sends a clear message to the executive body that the students want more streams in which they can take control over the mandates of those representing them.\n\nI\'ve taken other executive roles on grassroots campaigns, such as the Environment Students\' Society\'s initiative to build a new study space on campus and developing a coffee co-op program (both soon to be up and running in the next few weeks!), but I\'ll spare you the details of non-SSMU related activism unless you\'d like to hear more haha.\n\nIt is very true that I have spent a fair amount of time on presidential committees, sitting at SSMU council, or at senate, but what\'s important to recognize is that I\'ve done this as a student. I am not someone who has been wrapped up in these committees as part of my role on council, rather, as a student who wants to remind the executives of a student\'s perspective. The execs can (understandably) forget this perspective since they are CONSTANTLY at work in the office. I have done intensive research into what this role entails, so that, if elected, I can serve as a president that listens to, and serves the constituents of the society rather than one that perpetuates the unfortunate (but once again understandable) lack of faith that has been growing in the student body for the SSMU.\n\nI hope that answered your question but feel free to follow up and I can hopefully elaborate more on anything I missed! :)\n\nLastly, I was just wondering if could you clarify what you mean by ""when you have fulfilled or substantive divisive issues?""\n\nThanks again!', 'What are your thoughts on BDS Ben? ', ""Hey DonnyBurger22, part of me is glad you asked this and part of me is (i hope understandably) upset by it. However, I am not surprised, and when I say I am upset by it, it's simply because this - the idea that my personal struggle with depression could be interpreted as a campaign tactic - was a massive concern of mine from the start. During the printing process I specifically requested numerous times (and you can check with the Tribune about this if you'd like) to have the article published considerably before election period so that this wouldn't happen. However, the editorial calendar was rigid and the only spot available for publishing was the time that it inevitably came out at. Though I did think there would be enough space in-between publishing the article and announcing my candidacy to ensure they were not connected, I am not naive to the fact that some may still interpret it this way, so I am thankfully to you for giving me a platform to elaborate (and to your faith in my honesty).\n\nAdditionally, thank you for your question about the areas in which mental health support is lacking, let me try to address that. The core of the problem, as I see it now, is that many of the (in most cases great) efforts to improve campus mental health have *not* been focussed on preventative measures. In the last few years students have been cornered into providing funding to mental health spaces, services, and more. Though all of these initiatives are amazing, the lack of responsibility being taken by the admin to make it so students shouldn't have to come to these services in the first place has left much of the burden on the victims & students themselves.\n\nMy platform highlights some specific ways in which we can start to address these sorts of preventative solutions. One of them is lobbying for a Mandatory Mental Health 101 Training for faculty through senate. As well, other initiatives are highlighted that seek to support the clinic on the other end, by providing more space for it to run its group therapy session in the SSMU building.\n\nI hope this answered your question! :)"", ""As someone who has spent my entire life battling with mental illnesses, I couldn't welcome this comment enough. You are so right. I know many people with mental illnesses who are feeling the same way as you. I am familiar with Ben and can guarantee everything he says is a well-thought out political move. But never did I think he would stoop as low as to use mental illness to further his SMMU career."", ""I would agree that while I strongly strongly sympathize with Ben's situation in losing loved ones, it seems a period of intense sadness is a completely human way of reacting to such loss.

56,Could I get antidepressants at the McGill Clinic?,4xn8ez,13,"I'll be going to McGill this fall and was hoping to get an appointment at the clinic ASAP for a referral and birth control. However, I was wondering if the doctors at the clinic would be willing to prescribe me antidepressants as well. I've been having problems with my mental health probably since the beginning of high school, but never sought help as I didn't think the problem severe enough (I was friends with the ""crazies"" and very honestly didn't realize i had a problem until i started pulling myself out of that skewed worldview) and my parents generally don't buy into the mental disorder stuff unless it's so severe the person suffering from it has to be locked in an asylum. However, it's been getting worse so I was hoping I'd be able to take this opportunity away from my parents to get some help. I know drugs aren't a fix or anything but I've never been one to talk out my problems and I probably can't afford most other forms of treatment since I want to avoid going though my dad's insurance by paying out of pocket. 

Anyone have any experience with this? I was hoping to get this done during the same appointment for getting a referral and bc, but should I try to go through the mental health clinic instead? And are there other avenues I should explore instead? 

Thanks. ","['Just a tip for when you go to Mental Health (the only place at McGill that will prescribe you antidepressants for the first time): you should not ask for antidepressants directly.

58,Overloaded in ECSE help me please.,3tvnoh,18,"Hi,

I am really overloaded right now and have a lot of work and my finals are mostly very early. 
A particularly bad course has been MATH 263. Xu keeps positing the most fucked up assignments and I learn nothing by doing them and just end up wasting a lot of my time.

I failed my math midterms.

I feel like I have been deprived the opportunity to study.

Whenever I am in trottier or something I notice a lot of cheating on assignments and group work. This saddens me a lot.

I have only 2 real friends at mcgill both of which are not in my major (one friend who I knew before coming here and 1 that I made here),  although I know quite a few people. People do not respond to my messages when I suggest working on assignments together for some reason so group work is not doable. Sometimes I will ask someone to do group work, they will not respond then near the due date they will ask me how I did some questions. Being who I am and secretly hoping they would do the next assignment with me, I respond and help them. I however never get any help at all.

Heck I pretend like I have other friends when I'm with these 2 friends of mine cause I am so ashamed to admit I have no friends. I'm quite social and tried but always seem to lose touch with everyone. I pretend to be anti-social to excuse my lack of friends.

That eating at McDonald's alone thing on facebook is literally my life right now.

I got a full scholarship to Imperial College London yet made the stupid decision to come here because I thought Montreal and McGill would be a pleasant experience.

I don't know if I sound entitled but I feel like I deserve better lecturers that this given that I pay tuition and for many things that happened to me I feel like I have been treated unfairly compared to my peers. (It may be just in my head though)

I am wasting so much of my and my parents money that I feel guilty about it. 

I live near a highway and as much as I hate this I feel like going there and running into traffic. I almost did it some days ago then I stopped myself. If I do this I would have wasted money but not my parents due to the way things work. Also since I do not have many friends it should not affect too many people badly and for those who are affected they will get over it soon enough. I don't want to affect my friend's final exam performance though so perhaps I should wait till after them.  The person I knew before coming to mcgill is probably the only person apart from some relatives which would think about it.

Any tips from those of you who had similar semesters and survived would be greatly appreciated.

Right now what is on my mind is 
1) Dealing with the workload
2) Huge personal problems I have affecting my family
3) Injured friend in the Paris attacks
4) Money
5) Loneliness
6) Feeling tricked (given the people who get the grades by violating mcgill accademic integrity rules)

I have used mental health before and it has not been particularly useful apart from getting me to tell them my problems and listening to me.

Cheers

That says to me that you've got the potential to go far no matter the path you take in life.\n\nIf you want to do better in school, get a tutor. If you're paying this much for tuition, a few hundreds more or less shouldn't make a difference. This will help you avoid having to teach yourself everything for classes where the lectures are not the best. \n\nWhen dealing with a problem, first see if you have any control over it and if so, how. Come up with a list of what you can do to make a difference. Then just do your best. If things don't go your way, don't fret it and just move on. You get a lot of opportunities to roll the dice in life. Some times you win, some times you don't.\n\nAs for the loneliness issue, make some time for a club or for volunteering somewhere. It will make you feel better. For example, there are lots of retirement homes where the seniors would gladly welcome someone to talk to. Reduce your course load if you have to.

My strategy is essentially if it happens again, fuck redneck education and go back to the old country, even if it means losing Canada's permanent residency. I can always get it later through my parents I guess.\n\nIf you are French (by the username), you could try British unis, as an EU citizen you would not pay that much and you would have a much much better experience and feel rewarded for the work you put in.

I'm still wondering why the majority of people are much harsher towards their fellow students than the administration when their actions are much more harmful to you as a student. I do not understand this hypocrisy. I'm sorry if anyone felt they were being attacked by my comments, I tried to avoid it. I felt quite hurt reading the tone of the responses. This is what I meant about solidarity.. it seems there is no respect when students with differing views interact. Why can't we just be nice to each other even if we disagree? I feel like I am painted as a villain for having a belief you disagree with.  I assure you conversations become interesting instead of necessarily aggravating when you know more about a subject. I am sure you can see this point when you think about it. Also, I am not part of any radical student group so please don't see my views as a reflection of them.

------

From my perspective, McGill students aren't ruining the school's reputation, but the university is ruining it's own reputation...and they have much more of an effect on reputation than 6 party could ever have (does anyone disagree?). 

For example,

* Arthur Porter and the MUHC scandal
* Gary Dunphy's death threats
* The deputy provost not knowing student rights (telling students they don't have the right to protest on campus)
* The state of health/mental health services and counselling
....etc

I always think... what the fuck are we paying for? And I feel like most of the students here are like.....this is the best university! Shut up!

 What I don't understand is why is there no student solidarity? Not only that, I find students automatically side with the university or professors whenever there is a conflict. Why automatically assume they're right when you don't know the full story?

Some of you mocked undergrads like us, think we are stupid, and I clearly recall one of you hinting that I am simply not “cut-out” for this subject; and quite frankly, it's at those moments— I felt like giving up.

However, during every such moment, there always seems to one of you that handed me the help and the hope I needed. I remember being embarrassed having tears dripping down on my paper as I couldn’t understand your lectures. So you pretend you didn’t see it while continue to explain the concept for the 4th time. You also made sure to tell me I was doing a good job simply by trying before I leave. Another one of you taught me how to spot and forgive my own mistakes, both as a scientist and as a person.  You gave me guidance on career and on life. You were composed and wise. As a person who is hot-tempered and emotional, a good number of you taught me how to distance myself, think clearly and objectively. Some of your words are the same words that I will ponder upon perhaps for a better half of my lifetime.

**To My Fellow Classmen**

You are without a doubt some of the most daring and ambitious people I have ever seen. Don’t get me wrong, some of you are indeed arrogate, with an inflated sense of grandiose, and quite frankly not a nice person. But among you, I have also seen courage like I have never seen before. You influenced me to dream for a higher height, to be relentless, to have perseverance when it seems like that the pressure is too high, and the chances are too small. I came to McGill expecting a stepping stone to secure jobs/ a “normal life”, I go home disappointed. Little by little, you show me that despite its complicated existence, the world indeed has a place for dreams and passions, and for those who truly cares about thinking. I walk away holding those thoughts, your thoughts, about truth and life dear to my heart, and I hope to God, that I don’t forget them along my way.

**To my physics, computer science, stats, linear algebra TAs**

You don’t get paid enough for you do, thank you. You are nothing like some of the arrogant douchy guys I would meet in class. You are patient, kind, (funny in some cases :p) and cared about teaching me the tools to think. Unlike some people including some of my classmates, you didn't treat me as a girl in hard sciences, you treated me as just a scientist/researcher (even though I am yet far from it). We discuss theorems and corollaries for hours without realizing the time, until the security kick us out of the classroom. You respond to emails at midnights, make an effort to make time for me during your lunch hours. You taught me more than the professors ever did. I remember each one of your names, and I am so glad that some of us have become friends. And I am so happy that things are working out well for you guys, some of you have new jobs, got married, some are going to post-doc at amazing places, you have my deepest respect and I wish you all the best.

**To my best friends who happens to not understand a single thing about what I do:**

As fate would have it, we do not study the same thing, or even in the same faculty, and its miraculous that we met. However none of this stops you from being my biggest support(s). You keep me sane when I am lost in the competition, or rat race or whatever it is that you call it. You keep me focused on the bigger picture — well, we keep each other(s) focused on the bigger picture. You are forgiving of my mistakes, of my egos, while being honest. You are direct, yet gentle. You told me that if one day I had lost everything, I can always run to you. I thank you for the generosity that is your company, here is to many years to come!

**For future incoming first year McGillians:**

Before you enter the gates, whether you are feeling confused, excited, or anxious, it is all okay. Take a deep breath, and keep count, because it’s going to go by all too fast.

I want you to know that you DO NOT need to answer to anyone but yourself. Your job is to simply improve yourself in the ways that you seem fit (provided that you are a decent person). Never mind what other people think, and what other people say. People WILL laugh and mock at the clumsy way you make efforts, and the way you struggle, but don’t mind them. We mustn’t equate struggling to failing. We are learning, filling in our ignorances, exercising our weakness; which means that we are meant to be struggling. I am not going to lie, McGill is going to be hard, really really hard, and McGill as an institution does not make it any easier for you (with its mental health policies and over 600+ students classes etc.). But when it gets hard(and it will), you’re falling down again and again, don’t beat yourself up, face it, wear it like a badge of honour. Give yourself a break if you want to, but remember that struggling is far from failing; and I would even say that if you didn’t struggle, that might be the biggest failure of all.

There is good news however, you are not alone in this. You will also meet amazing people. Whenever you see fit, learn from them, and let them change your life. With a little bit of luck, your time at McGill won’t be the best years of your life, because you will have grown and learned so much at this place that will benefit you in the future, that your best years would have yet to come.

All the best,

S.C.

70,Let’s open up a convo about ADD/ADHD at McGill?,be3w7s,14,"I feel like no one talks about this + that it’s very misunderstood anyone else ? So I’m gonna go ahead and dip my toes a lil. 

Here’s what I have to say to anyone struggling with this as well. 

I am a U2 in PSYC and I was diagnosed with ADD at age 7-8. I’ve been on medication ever since. I would say my ADD is extremely bad, I literally can’t function in any academic setting without my medication and that has been the case ever since I started highschool. Like I’m the forgets their laptop at home type on a normal day if I don’t take it...It’s hard for me to even keep up with simple daily tasks if I don’t take my medication. During the summer when I’m off my medz, I do things like unlock my door when I get home and close the door behind me with my full key chain still in the keyhole just sitting there all night (feel free to come rob me anytime) and I do that at least twice a month. Or if someone tells me « don’t forget you have to do this today, bring that tomorrow » , I forget 100% of the time if I don’t put some sort of a reminder for it on my phone and even then I might not notice the reminder when it comes even if it’s like the stupidest thing or even if I tell myself I’ll do it in 20 mins, I forget within 5 mins of that person telling me. Or like I’ll forget that there’s mayo in the fridge even though it’s right in my face every time I open it and i’ll go buy another pot of mayo...? 

In highschool, I would forget my books and homework at home all the time and my peers just couldn’t grasp how I could be so lunatic. I was almost failing chemistry and physics despite that I would study hours and hours for it to the point where my chemistry teacher met up with me and was just like « you’re coming to all the extra lunch hours and do all the nonmandatory work how did you manage to fail this test » , and I was like idkkk dude it just all sounded like white noise to me.  Not to mention during that time I would be literally fucked up on vyvanse at school everyday like HIGH as shit in order to pass those classes which led me to have anxiety attacks multiple times when I would try to go to sleep at night. I pushed through and then when I got to CEGEP in humanities and math everything started to feel so easy. 

I was watching my friends struggle in classes which I would ace with minimal effort. I had incredible accomodations : 50% more time for all my exams for which teachers already gave  more time than needed, computer, dictionnaries, antidote. I was still putting in the work but didn’t need as high of a dose anymore and never had to worry about a bad grade and it honestly boosted my self-esteem so much I felt great. 
I got into McGill in the snap of a finger. 

My plan from age 9 up to this point was I wanted to become a school psychologist, which involves getting into grad school and lord knows that’s extremely difficult for just a regular functioning gifted student so now imagine for an average with ADD. Yeah. 

Honestly, entering classes at McGill has been the most difficult challenge of my life in terms of dealing with my ADD in school. I knew it was going to be hard, but never would I have imagined that’s how hard it was gonna be and especially how much of a tole it would take on my mental health. My U1 was probably the lowest point of my entire life, I was absolutely lost in those neuroscience PSYC classes and didn’t know how to study for exams, how to manage readings. All throughout highschool and CEGEP almost all my exams were all essay questions so those multiple choice exams literally seemed impossible to even pass for me (still kinda do) even with my accommodations which by the way were far reduced from what I had before uni...

Also other things were going on in my life with family and friends and I fell into depression. I finally decided to go to counselling. I had 4 classes, dropped 1, failed one which my counsellor gave me a withdrawal permission for, and almost failed one. I felt worthless and helpless, this was worst than chemistry, I had not felt that way since my first year of highschool when I was so behind on everyone else in my class that’s when my parents and teachers realized I would need accommodations. 
But in my second semester, I took some electives and actually aced 2 of my classes. Still struggled in PSYC though. Now I am finishing my second year, this semester I knew I was taking classes that were gonna be challenging for me so I only took 3 to allow myself to put in more time for each class. A couple weeks ago, I also got a last minute interview for a lab as a volunteer and got the job which I never thought I could do this early on because of my grades. During that first year I started to almost completely give up on the idea that I might one day make it to grad school, but this honestly gave me some faith back. I don’t know if I’m gonna make it but I know for sure I at least want to try. 

I still struggle so much in PSYC with doing readings and with the multiple choice exams still. I work my ass off and get ok grades, it sucks, but I am so much further than I thought I would be at this point in time !! 

And it’s gonna be hard let me tell you, you’re gonna see your friends who work a 20hr and have 6 classes get easy 3.7’s while remaining sane and you’ll have to put in double the time and effort to barely catch up to them. But once you see that it’s possible to get better and how much progress you’ve made that’s what will push you to keep going !!!

In university, your entourage and people in general will be harsher than when you were a kid and will expect you to now « get it together » and that all your symptoms will all the sudden vanish in thin air which we all know won’t happen. I recommend ignoring that and possibly seeking counselling which is what I did. 

Find out what works for you. It might take a while...and it might be different from what you used to do before mcgill. If something ain’t it, keep trying new methods and don’t settle if you think you haven’t found the right one yet. Like you might only find out in your last semester. For me that’s something I’ve had to accept, that I am finding things that work really well for me that I could have been doing this whole time, but I just tell myself better late than never. 

Get the accommodations you need at OSD and definitely get on medication. These medications are also anxiety inducing most often which
is also something you will have to work around. I personally can never go back to being on such high doses like I was before CEGEP and the anxiety for the sake of my mental health. This also means I am a tad bit more loony than I probably should be, but I work around it. 

Finally, accept that you will have to work twice as hard to catch up to others and don’t beat yourself up for it (still working on that myself). Know that it will get better and pay off in the end (also working on that still). 

This shit is really fucking hard tho !!!! Everyone who is dealing with this y’all are the real ones never forget it !! 

Please share your stories, experiences and advices on the topic of add/adhd in this thread so we can all learn something and give each other support :) 

Let’s talk !","['McGill/OSD likes to believe that just because they offer stopwatch time, NTCs and extra time on exams, it’s somehow solving all the barriers that ALL people with disabilities face. Even for mental disorders, it doesn’t get to the heart of the barriers for most people. \n\nI’d look into academic literature on the social versus medical models of disability, for anyone struggling to make sense of their condition against the mindset McGill takes on disability. Many students have pointed out the failure McGill has done to foster a welcome learning environment for those with physical or mental conditions.', ""I've mentioned this here before but since I restarted taking medication^1 I've realized what I'm good at studying. Reading heavy classes are a pain for me cause it takes me wayyyy longer than normal to read. I switched into Economics and maths after my first year here and it's so much better for me. I am more engaged with the content and I feel way more efficient studying for it.\n\nAlso, the OSD fucking sucks. I've been playing with the idea of forming an OSD student board/some sort of OSD student representation (if there isn't already). Everyone seems to have the same problems with them and I don't see anything being done about it. Also, while their accommodations are nice, they feel a little indelicate. I feel like things like notetaking and extended time on exams make classes easier, as opposed to accommodating disabilities, if you know what I mean. Then again, I'm an Econ student, so what do I know?\n\nHot take: taking study drugs without a diagnosis/prescription is academic dishonesty. It trivializes/cheapens the experience of people with actual ADHD and is a shitty practice that McGill turns a blind eye to.\n\n\n1: I took concerta from age 9-14, when in my first year of high school my parents found out I smoked weed and they decided having access to a high risk drug (stimulants) was not something I could be trusted with (you can laugh, it's a funny situation, I don't hold any resentment or anything). I started again my senior year of high school."", ""What I will say is that people really assume that you're not as intelligent as they are when you have ADD. You don't even have to tell them that you have ADD for that to be the case--people will judge you for having difficulty taking notes or forgetting things regularly. \n\nMy ADD is not that severe compared to OP, but I still get judged for being relatively out of it. Like yah dawg, I had no clue the test was this week, but that doesn't mean I'm intellectually less than you are for not being organized, or that I'm going to do poorly in the class. \n\nMedication helps a lot but then people stigmatize you for needing drugs to cope. We should all recognize that as students, we have different circumstances. There's no one size fits all to doing your best."", 'Thank you for posting ♥️♥️', 'I have ADHD (diagnosed when young as well) and do relatively well in school. Going into my last year here in September (done exams!). \n\nMy biggest piece of advise is -- controversially -- to try to work without using medication. I have been on various amphetamine drugs (including Vyvanse) so the following comes from experience: these drugs will help you outwardly ""calm down"", but they do not really help you process or understand information better. Anyone who has been on amphetamines will confirm that you\'re legit ""high"" on these drugs. Personally, I felt my thinking was always clouded. I still use meds rarely, but not for studying -- more for anxiety or when I have a panic attack like situation.\n\nInstead, starting in the last year of high school, I stopped using meds for class/school. It\'s a lot harder to focus and pay attention, but I feel like I retain and understand the information a lot better. I use short-term goal setting (things to do this week, things to do today, things to do this hour, etc.) to refocus myself. I have a sticky note on my desktop and a notebook I carry around where I have these goals listed. I use this in combination with frequent (really frequent) breaks to cover the material. I also found it really important to study on my own, without help from friends/profs/TA. People help you understand concepts, but I always found this was outweighed by the distracting effect they had on me. I would pay more attention to my prof than to the material, if that makes sense. I do not know if these will work for you or others, but I hope you are able to find some sort of non-medical refocusing tool to manage your ADHD. \n\nImportantly, I am not against the use of amphetamines. They have helped me a lot. I do, however, believe that we ADHD people use these drugs too much and over rely on them because they are so effective. Honestly, 2 months after I stopped being a daily user (which I was for all of high school) I felt 10x smarter. Like I had been in some sort of stupor before.\n\nOther piece of advice is to study things which are naturally interesting to you (refocusing is much easier) and things which you have some intuitive grasp of. Reading -- which I sucked at for all of high school, and still struggle with a bit -- helps a lot too in terms of trying to train attention. Ultimately, I believe a lot of effort can mitigate some of the downsides with ADHD. I\'ve seen this with many of my friends. Of course, this is not to disparage people with severe forms of the disorder who practically need meds all of the time. Have met people like this too.\n\nFor me, I knew this is something I had to deal with in uni as most employers are even worse than OSD. I have heard some bad stories from older friends on how little their employers care about the disorder. Hope some of this helps, feel free to send me a pm.', ""Absolutely. And now requiring people to schedule their own OSD finals definitely isn't helpful to us with organizational and time management issues."", 'Absolutely agree !

I'm an international student from the states and I was wondering if there's any way that I could stay in Canada and have a work permit? I was thinking I could apply for permanent residency? The reason that my grades got so low is because of my mental health, and going back to the US would mean losing my support system and my therapist, and having to move back in with my Mom, none of which would be healthy for me.

If you do work without a visa/for cash and you get caught, you will be removed from the country and not allowed entry for I believe a MINIMUM of a year, maybe more.', ""I've navigated a vaguely similar situation.\n\nThe conditions of your study permit are that you are a full time student. If you are no longer enrolled at McGill, you will have to leave Canada.\n\nYou definitely cannot stay as a visitor and work, as others here have said. If you do want to work, you're going to have to get a work permit that's independent of your study permit (which will no longer be valid). I think someone here suggested a PR but I think that might be harder for you to get. In any case, going for the work permit or the PR is going to be difficult in Quebec if you don't speak french or have any qualifications/skills/job offers unfortunately :/ \n\nThis is a tough situation, I can sympathize with having trouble due to emotional issues, I was in a similar boat.\n\nOne thing that might be an option for you is to apply to Concordia, take classes there, do well, and try to reapply to McGill. In my opinion this is probably your most realistic chance of staying in Montreal.\n\nI would go to the international students office for advice, they've likely seen this before.\n\nI want to stress that you will have to leave the country soon after your enrollment is terminated, the penalties for failing to do so can be severe."", 'you can apply for PR but you need to be fluent in French (B2/B2 level). preparing for French exam will take a long time (depends on person. but going to take at least one year-year and a half) in order to receive a document called CSQ. once you pass french exam with B2/B2 scores and apply for CSQ,  you need to wait more than a year for it to be processed. after long wait and if you manage to receive CSQ, then you apply for PR and this will take another 18-20months. so basically, if you wanna become PR, you need to spend almost 2.5-3 years. so i would say becoming PR wont be a good idea. and for the cashjob, ive heard some restos are still offering cashjobs but if you get caught (and especially when you are international student or with visitor visa), there’s high chance that you’ll get deported. it sounds harsh but you can still apply for visitor visa and just take semester off and then apply for readmission and once you get accepted then you apply for new student visa + CAQ.', 'There is of course the danger of not being accepted to Concordia once being kicked out of another university because of marks.  \nOP could apply to a CEGEP program though.']"

73,Graduate school with a handicap,alu58n,22,"I got accepted into graduate school (Master's), but I am unsure whether it is a good idea for me to accept. I'm from northwestern Europe, but have briefly lived in Montreal before and really liked it (and the rent is amazing!) However, I have autism that interferes with my academics. In short, this means that I don't perform well under a full course load; I can do around 60-80% of what is ideally expected (as in 15 credits per semester is ideal at McGill). I got funding for 2 years (5 semesters, including one summer), and the program is 45 credits. One must finish the program in 3 years.

This is my problem: I found out that McGill has a graduate failure policy ([https://mcgill.ca/study/2018-2019/university\_regulations\_and\_resources/graduate/gps\_gi\_failure\_policy](https://mcgill.ca/study/2018-2019/university_regulations_and_resources/graduate/gps_gi_failure_policy)) that is extremely strict in comparison to university in my home country (we don't even have failure policies!) To compare, failing a course here is a bummer but not at all uncommon; a lot of classes have a success rate of <80%, and sometimes even <70% (or less!). If failing two courses would mean leaving university, then some of my tenured professors would have never even graduated. So I'm quite surprised about this policy.

I also understand that you need a minimum of 12 credits per semester to maintain full-time status at McGill. This is particularly unfortunate for me because a study visa requires full time enrollment, so taking less credits one semester is then not an option. Curiously this also means that I am over-funded; I am financially supported long enough to allow for only 45/5=9 credits per semester.

I would love to attend McGill but I value my mental health, and attending makes no sense if it is not viable for me to eventually obtain a degree.

Did I correctly understand the mentioned McGill policies? If so, are there any options available for students with disabilities that could help my situation? For example, in my home country a degree is usually 3 years, and I was allowed to complete it in 4 (with no charges for the extra year).

&#x200B;

Thank-you so much in advance for any advise you might have for me!

Best wishes to all.","['Congrats on your acceptance ! \n\n\nI would suggest you talk with the OSD they can help you navigate the process of disclosure and help you talk with the dept...however don\'t depend on them 100% you will need to be an advocate for yourself !!\n\nSome Departments are a bit strict but if you register with the OSD and explain the situation they(your dept) should be able to work with you to find accommodation that works for your program .... unfortunately some programs  require that you take classes in a particular order and only offer them in certain semesters (ie fall only or winter only)...I don\'t know how it works in regards to your visa but if you have documentation provided to the OSD then you technically could be considered full time time while taking a reduced course load. \n\n\nIts not unheard of to take extra time to complete a masters degree however you will be expected to pay (its a fixed fee for ""continuation"") \n\nBest of Luck , It can be frustrating  sometimes to navigate the system but don\'t give up and DO NOT take NO for an answer, administrators and departments  at McGill can sometimes be a bit to stubborn , take the time to get to know your dept graduate  coordinator as they will be your main point of contact...', ""Congrats on your acceptance! \n\nAs for your question, it would be easier for us to help you if you mention which department you were accepted into.

75,Side projects and internships as a CS student,agswvv,8,"Heyo, so I'm majoring in Comp Sci after doing 1.5 years (3 semesters) in a small competitive program in Bio/Life sciences (starts with an N), hating it, taking a 'mental health gap year' after some shit went down, and finally switching into CS for Fall 2018. I'm a U3 set to graduate in 2020 as a U4 (even though I basically skipped over my U2 year lol)

The summer is rolling around, and I would love to apply for internships, but I am struck with a sense of complete uselessness and inadequacy, coupled with some hardcore job anxiety. I've taken some/most of the core CS courses (COMP 251, all the other 200s, COMP 302, COMP 303) but I still don't feel confident to do anything with my skills. I'm really only solid in Java; I've been coding in Java since I was 15. I know some C, Python, and Javascript, but I don't feel super comfortable with them.

I don't really have anything to show for my abilities; I have some Java mini-games I made in high school and some COMP 206 stuff on my GitHub, and my GPA is pretty okay/good, but this way of marketing myself in the tech industry is new to me. I had a killer semester last Fall to make up for the transfer, so I didn't have the time/motivation to do any side projects.

I always feel like I'm not doing enough and I'll just end up graduating with all this theoretical knowledge but not knowing how to do anything someone can pay me for.

Any suggestions/advice on the following would be helpful.

* Have you done any side projects? How do you have the time for them as a full-time student? Is it better to set aside some time to do side projects, even if that means letting my GPA slide a little?
* I struggle with motivation; how do you get the motivation to do side projects? I get bored too easily and I'm always too stressed about midterms/finals to sit down and get anything done.
* Is there any point applying for internships? My CV/GitHub/LinkedIn is kinda crap, having just transferred in -- should I ask my Tim Hortons boss to hire me back this summer?

Sorry for the length; any insight would be helpful. Also I know this comes off as low self-esteem-y but I'm in therapy who isn't at this point

TL;DR Recently transferred CS student with a lot of job anxiety/feelings of inadequacy looking to do an internship; how important are side projects, and should I apply to internships even though my CV is poo?","[""I don't think you need a lot of experience to apply for internships. As long as you know Java and you can solve basic problems, I'm sure you can find a decent position, at least something to begin with. (I got my first internship with only comp202 and no prior programming experience).\n\nSide projects are nice, but its not easy to find time and motivation to work on those. You can show project that you did for school on your github, as long as you explain what was the goal and how you achieved it. Eventually just having internships on your CV will lead you to better internships.\n\nSome of the best experience I got at McGill for industry were COMP321 or the competitive programming club and hackathons. If you are only going for a full time job after graduating, I wouldn't worry too much about your GPA.

If you actually love or care about programming, then finding motivation should not be hard, but from my personal experience what can be hard is to find (and decide to focus on) a particular topic since there are so many to chose from. For me, doing such projects is motivating because it is constructive and intellectually stimulating and you get improve your skills and learn new techniques. I started programming when I was 9 years old, started very small and learnt to write increasingly sophisticated programs, and when I'm in a good optimistic mood I like to think of it as a lifelong journey, although as you allude about yourself I have some self-esteem and mood stability problems, which I am sure McGill's heartless competitive nature has contributed a lot to. I think having something more than just a degree (could be side projects, could be internships, could be other things as well) will be useful (if not necessary) in the coming years in order to find jobs in the increasingly saturated and competitive field that this has become, so as to stand out from all the people trying to get by with as little as possible.

This wouldn't snowball into something students use for every course since you can only opt for S/U in electives.\n\n If you use S/U to lighten the effective workload of a course, then yeah, this does defeat the point of S/U. But if you use S/U as a cautionary measure on courses you plan to do all the work for but don't know if you'll do well in and don't want a potential poor grade in to lower your GPA, then this allows you to be rewarded for your work if you end up doing well.

Nothing you have said is justified because you and/or your SSMU handlers don't understand the concept of a grading system in the context of choosing courses to take as pass/fail.

The very point of it is that your grade does not matter! \n\nIt honestly sounds completely backwards. GPA boosting purely for the sake of GPA boosting accomplishes nothing positive except make some students happy on the short term, and devalues the work of students who take their education seriously by creating more opportunities for GPA inflation among students who play the system to maximize grades.\n\nGPA is the grade point average and it should be the average of the grade points achieved by the student. A course in which the grade point scheme is ""either it doesn\'t count towards my GPA or it\'s a 4.0 that counts towards the GPA"" makes absolutely no sense in that context, in order for GPA to be representative of performance there has to be a downside in doing poorly if there is to be an upside in doing well otherwise you might as well just add 0.5 to everyone\'s GPA right now and call it a day.\n\nI think a more reasonable measure would be to convert the S to an A or A- on the transcript if the student achieves those, without counting it in to the GPA.', ""> But if you use S/U as a cautionary measure on courses you plan to do all the work for but don't know if you'll do well in and don't want a potential poor grade in to lower your GPA, then this allows you to be rewarded for your work if you end up doing well.

It\'s about providing students with an opportunity to be recognized for hard work in difficult classes that fall outside of their comfort zones. If an Arts student, for example, has enjoyed their Science elective and coming into the final knows that they could end up with an A, they should have the option to study hard and know that their work will be recognized.

In terms of consultation, I brought this up with students in every faculty and in about 70 different 1-1 conversations that I had while considering running for this position, including conversations with students that I know and those that I don\'t. In those conversations, I heard one negative comment and tweaked the proposal to respond to the concern raised. That being said, the more consultation the better. If it is really the case that many students think this is unnecessary or that it would be preferable to not have the grade count towards GPA, then I\'ll respond to that. I think this is a good, beneficial idea, but I\'m not wedded to it and am happy to ditch it. I\'m sure you would agree, though, that we would need more than three commenters here to prove that it is an ""embarrassment."" Acting on these comments, right now and as it stands, would strike me as both poor consultation and as also unfair to the students with whom I had conversations. I\'m happy to think about how we can continue to gauge interest on this, and am open or responsive to suggestions from this forum. I\'ll work on thinking up some stronger consultative process on this topic and check back in by the end of the week, but please do let me know if you have any ideas!\n\nI\'d encourage those interested in or critical of this proposal to check out the policies at[ Columbia](https://www.college.columbia.edu/facultyadmin/grading) and[ Yale](https://yalecollege.yale.edu/new-students/transfer-students/general-academic-information/creditdfail-option). They were definitely the inspiration for this idea.\n\nI also want to respond to the claim here that this proposal only offers upside, without no downside. Or, to quote from above: ""in order for GPA to be representative of performance there has to be a downside in doing poorly if there is to be an upside in doing well otherwise you might as well just add 0.5 to everyone\'s GPA right now and call it a day."" There is a downside. You can still get a ""U"".\n\nNext, I want to respond to the idea that this will encourage more students to take S/U option. Yes, that is the goal! However, it should not be so quickly assumed that it will also encourage students to ""simply abuse that option to take easy classes with the comfortable guarantee that they cannot get any grade lower than A counting towards their GPA."" There is no value in taking easy classes under the ""S/U"" option. An ""S"" is often understood to be lower than an ""A""; it is also lower than an A-, B+, and arguably a B too. I get that students can avoid having a non-A counting towards their GPA, but they would still have an easy class with an ""S"" on their transcript. It is also worth mentioning that students are only able to take a maximum of 1 elective per year, and so it is very hard for this to become some huge grade inflation problem.\n\nFundamentally, I think students working hard in class that is difficult and outside of their comfort zone should be rewarded for it, should they end up doing well. I think most students would agree too. Is this a huge, landmark change? No. Is this something that could directly impact some students, improve the quality of learning by encouraging students to go outside their comfort zones, while not incurring any risk or downside? Ya, it seems likely. Again, this isn\'t about ""GPA boosting"". It is about encouraging students to take classes that they otherwise wouldn\'t. Should we pursue this idea, we would obviously track whether students end up taking more classes under the ""S/U"" option, which I think would be a good thing, and whether grades are inflated because of this, which I doubt will happen.

It is about encouraging students to take classes that they otherwise wouldn\'t. \n\nIf you are thinking this, then why are you pushing a measure that does the exact opposite of that ?? Your measure literally starts punishing students for taking interesting electives because as of right now, there is no way to increase your GPA by taking a S/U course so it\'s a tool that is available for students who care about learning. There is thus zero downside in using your S/U option (which you get course a year with) on a hard course. If you change the system in the way you suggest, in order to compete with students who use it on an easy course at no GPA penalty, you will have to use it on easy courses as well if you don\'t want to be objectively losing out, which is literally the opposite of what you are claiming you want to do.\n\n>Is this a huge, landmark change? No. \n \nEither this is too small to be relevant and then why is that one of your big goals, are there not more useful things to be thinking about ?

People who are gunning for a 3.95+ GPA will not take classes that are difficult as S/U because they can\'t use that to increase their GPA;  if they have some catching up to do GPA wise, they are better off taking a ""bird course"" and achieving an A. There is a risk to this though because some bird courses end up being more challenging than planned and lowering those people\'s GPAs, although that is not very common. This risk is what makes it fair to allow students to boost their GPA by  cherry picking electives. \n\nIf you were to change the grading system to allow students to get an A with the S/U option, then that risk would entirely disappear. Students going for 3.95+ GPAs could, once a year, take an easy elective course, with the absolute certainty that it cannot result in a GPA loss. Either they achieve the A and improve their GPA, or it does not count at all. They would thus be applying this system to ""bird courses"" that they would already have taken before with the aim of getting an A, but now with zero possible downside, resulting on this group of students overall achieving higher GPAs.\n\nFor a student going for a 3.95+ GPA, there would be no upside in taking a harder course with that option given that there is the opportunity to take the bird course, since the harder course is less likely to result in an A, and thus less likely to improve their GPA. I understand that your measure could be interesting for students who focus on the quality of their learning experience but many of those people are already using the S/U option. The system you are suggesting would promote using the S/U option as a freebie GPA boosting guaranteed resource by people who are already looking to take advantage of the system (the weak GPA consistency across departments at mcgill).\n\nThese people abusing the proposed S/U option to improve their GPA would then be at an advantage compared to their peers who would not be doing the same, which would encourage other students competing for high GPA opportunities like NSERC to adopt the same behavior.\n\nI understand that we are talking about relatively low inflation here, but it\'s a relatively low-impact measure you are suggesting, so if most of the impact of such a measure is negative I simply don\'t understand how it can be deemed a reasonable idea. It honestly is a bit scary to me that you had not even considered this, which I was quickly summarizing because I assumed it was something that you had thought about. I hope this will have helped shed some light on how your system could be abused as a GPA boosting freebie.\n\nI do think that allowing the grade to be shown on the transcript without counting towards the GPA would be a good ""feel-good"" measure of similar impact for people to whom it matters without being abusable for GPA purposes.', ""I'll let Jacob respond to the rest of this, but just to clarify - as a whole, the Senators are working on many more projects and initiatives than the 3 that were listed.

', ""I believe if they didn't show up the would get an incomplete, not an S. But to answer your question, yes."", ""just because it's not a given doesn't mean it should be discounted for being contrary to your proposal. it's certainly an edge case, but it's an edge case your proposal makes possible."", ""You are right. It would be better for the student to go. I guess, also, to clarify, my test situation would actually have to involve someone who is already has 50ish marks in the course at the time of the exam because if they already passed then even if they got a 0 on the exam they still couldn't get a U. Sorry about that.   \n\n\nAnyway, thanks for answering. I guess we disagree. Not really sure where else to go from there but would be interested to hear if more people think similarly. I'll probably bring this to SSMU legislative council, so that would give folks here ample time to communicate with their reps.  "", ""Forgive me, but it doesn't seem like you uphold the same standard that you impose on others when it comes to rigour of thought, intellectual honesty, or even just decency in terms of answering a fairly basic question. Look, I get that I'm elected and you aren't; so, if you want to use that as your reason not to answer my question then go for it! But, for all the comments about my intellect and character, I do-- perhaps naively-- believe that you (a) care about holding ssmu elected officials accountable and (b) think this S/U change is a bad idea. As such, I'm trying to engage. Whatever you wrote there, though, doesn't really give me anything to work with. "", ""I think I'm understanding your question now that I've slept. You're asking about if, **under the status quo** (I didn't think you were asking about this when I first answered), students would prefer: (A) a U and the possibility to retake the course to an (B) S (which does not affect their GPA)?\n\nNo they would not, because there's no benefit to having just an S after taking the course a 2nd time."", ""Thanks! Somehow we still aren't communicating well, but since you tried to answer-- now that I've slept-- I'll try again too:   \n\n\nDo you think, under my proposed system, that a student taking a course S/U and on track to get an S (in the C to B range) would intentionally start tanking to ensure that they get a U so that they could maybe have the option to retake the course and get an A the second time? It seems to me that this is highly improbable. It is a really big/stupid risk to take.   "", ""Yes, I think that would still happen. It would be uncommon, but still an available option for the student if they don't mind losing the 3 attempted credits the first time around. My point is that while uncommon, the door would still be open for that option, no matter how foolish it might be.""]"
77,phys 131 real talk,9pvw5y,16,"As a student with a very minimal physics background in high school, PHYS 131 is a real struggle. I only took one year of physics in high school, spending the remaining 3 years on IB Chemistry instead. My math background is also very robust, having skipped 2 years of math and finished the default high school curriculum by 10th grade.

I understand that many of you really like Ragan as a professor, and I admire him as well. But he is also very intimidating and in a big haste during lectures, so almost every one of my questions is brushed aside and I am simply told that I ""really should be familiar with it by now"". 

Being honest, that kind of attitude really makes a student feel terrible and creates a big emotional barrier between the student and the professor. And then his clicker questions always suggest that you're supposed to learn every concept very quickly. Not to mention that I've been struggling with CAPA assignments ever since the 4th one. 

The PHYS 131 midterm is on Tuesday and I've honestly hit a breaking point. I haven't been doing so well in some of my other classes either. I bombed the COMP 202 midterm and am losing my grip on MATH 133 as well. My second quiz for MATH 133 will occur within half an hour of my physics midterm.

How did I fall this deep into the hole? I'm constantly feeling left behind and it's been taking a big toll on my mental health. I'm tired of pretending that everything is fine. I'm lost.","[""I was in exactly the same situation, only without the chemistry background you claim to have. \n\nThere will always be people that are better prepared, but don't think for a second they didn't work for it. All this means is you need to build up that experience and prepare yourself now. Review the lecture notes after the days classes and ask yourself did you understand the lecture. If not do a couple of questions from the text book. For physics you'll find that the approaches in easier problems can provide great insight and get you going on more difficult Kappa questions. Finally, prepare yourself for upcoming lectures by reading ahead in the textbook - the syllabus should be online somewhere. This is your education and you are in control of it. \n\nI also want to point out, there's most likely loads of people having the same issues with chemistry that I expect you are not having. Take advantage of that. Don't think about your focus on chemistry in HS as a disadvantage - it should provide you the opportunity to focus on physics and math now. \n\nKappa is really as hard as it gets for 131 - when I took the class it was the basis for the midterms and finals so if you're struggling with them, that's normal. It's not your ordinary homework. Be positive - don't sulk over your comp exam - and work hard. That's the expectation and it'll help you succeed when you graduate. McGill teaches tenacity and a good work ethic better than anything else.\n\nFinally, reach out to your TAs and Ragan for help if you need it. They are just as much resources as your textbook and the internet. They want you to learn, not to suffer."", 'Adding on to /u/McGillMATHLUVA I would also say that the first year physics courses are inherently very tough because the math you need to fully understand the material is usually taught in advanced calculus courses (MATH 314, for example). I bet that more people than you think are in your shoes in regards to the class. \n\nIf you have anything that is giving you a lot of trouble for the class (or for COMP 202 or MATH 133 as well) feel free to PM me and I can try to help you out.\n\nEdit: wording ', 'I\'ve taken all of those classes (as have many other people), so PM if you need help. \n\nAlso, remember a few things:\n\n - I know it doesn\'t really help you, but you\'re far from alone. \n\n - For many first year classes, your final can replace your midterm. Obviously it\'s better not to rely on that, but all is not lost if you have a bad day and screw up a midterm.\n\n - A lot of the time, people in your shoes are just so overwhelmed that they don\'t know where to start. You need to get yourself out of that hole. My suggestion would be to pick up your textbook or other material for each class and go back to the last point where you understood what was going on, even if you have to go back several weeks. Start working form there. As soon as you get stuck somewhere, go ask somebody about that concept. For example, maybe you\'ll get stuck on determinants in 133 or centripetal acceleration in 131. It\'s amazing how much clearer things get when someone explains a concept that you\'ve been confused about. You can go to your prof\'s office hours, but there\'s also FrezCa, the math help desk (Burnside 911), TAs, Khan Academy (which saved me in my first year), 3Blue1Brown for 133, and a host of other resources. If one resource feels intimidating, then choose a different one. Then keep working and stop every time you get stuck. You might be tempted to brush over something you don\'t understand because you\'re anxious or ""in a hurry"", but at the end of the day that\'s not going to get you anywhere. \n\n - Try to write everything down on a piece of paper. Take one sheet for every course and write down every topic that\'s been covered, and then cross off the ones you understand (be honest). If in doubt, don\'t cross it off. Then go to the first topic that isn\'t crossed off and start there. You might want to create a (realistic) schedule, but you don\'t necessarily have to. Writing stuff down is just a way for you to organize your thoughts and get a handle on your situation so that, hopefully, it isn\'t so overwhelming that you become paralyzed by stress, if that makes sense. \n\nAlso, for PHYS 131 specifically:\n\n - Ragan won\'t give you a test question that requires integrals.\n\n - CAPA questions are harder than test questions. \n\n - There are past exams on docuum (if you don\'t know what that is, check it out), and Ragan posts past exams as well. \n\n - There might be a cram session offered by EUS, so look out for that on Facebook. \n\n - Khan Academy and Youtube have a lot of very similar questions to the CAPA ones, so it often helps to watch the questions and do them along with the video until you understand the general process. You can also find explanations for the exact same questions on the internet most of the time. ', ""I also barely had any physics background, nothing like the students coming from IB or AP  seemed to.\n\nGot a D in both of PHYS 131 and MATH 133 and am currently taking both of them again. \n\nI can assure that after having taken them for a year, and now having some sort of background, the concepts are significantly easier to grasp. You are in no way less intelligent than your peers, even though it really may seem that way. You were just less prepared than they were, at no fault of your own.\n\nYou'll probably fail the physics midterm. And that's okay! Lots of students do. Now you know how difficult Ragan's physics class is, and that you'll have to work harder in that class than probably any of the others you're currently taking. "", ""I'm honestly so scared for the physics midterm, like you i have my math133 quizz 30 minutes before the midterm and the next day i have my math150 midterm so i'm really struggling with all the work right now.\nBut remember the midterm can count for 0% so if you fail it's ok, the final is on the 19th so if you have your other final before it'll give you the time to work on it. The math133 quizz is only worth 5% so it's not so much and if you read the book and do the exercices in it you'll probably do well. \nFor physics my only strategy is to do all the exercices in the text book so that on the midterm i'll be familiar with so much type of problems that i should feel somewhat safe."", 'You’re not alone. A lot of McGill students have struggled through those courses. One bad midterm and one bad quiz will suck now but it it’s not the end of the world. What you really have to do is get some help and catch up before your too overwhelmed. I suggest finding a TEAM member or a TA you like (not too much hehe) and taking some time to walk through the material with them. Or better yet, make friends with someone who is succeeding in the course and is willing to help you with CAPA/Studying, a lot of students hone their skills when they teach it to someone else so it is good for them too! Working with others always makes me feel so much less alone so I highly recommend it! Keep working at it and you will get it, don’t give up!', ""Dude I feel you about being in a hole during midterms. Last winter, when I was a U0, I got strep during all my midterms (mid to late February) and spent 10 days in bed. After recovering, I wound up doing piss poor on most of my midterms (almost failed one). It took a total drain on me mentally as well. \n\nMy advice is to just move on and try to focus on the future. After a bad exam, there is literally nothing you can do to change the outcome. First thing is go to your prof and TA's office hours as often as possible. Hell, go every week if you need to. The second thing is figure out how you can change your study habits so that you retain information and understand it better. \n\nAs for the mental health piece, don't let yourself sink further there. If you need to find someone to talk to, do that. Feel free to hit my inbox if you really need to talk to someone. Finally, I'd encourage you to exercise at least every weekday, it'll help clear your mind and keep you motivated. Anyways, good luck with everything and I hope your midterm goes well!"", ""Thanks for the warm and helpful responses everyone. To be honest, I created this thread mainly for the reassurance that I wasn't the only one who was struggling. \n\nI have a small circle of friends who know the physics content much better than I do, so I eventually developed an inferiority complex and am still struggling to deal with it when around them. \n\nI already had a plan in mind; I would start attending MATH 133 and FrezCa tutorials and doing extra problems online or out of the textbook. The only problem was that I felt so much dread that my mental state just snapped. "", ""There is no worse physics department than our at Concordia. Idk about McGill bit id love to see people take our exams. They are legit hell. To the point people refuse to sign up to fill classes because the failing rate is so high. Im a biochemist but math has always been my love and strength among many courses. I had some trouble though with physics at first because its a lot of material. Coming from someone who has a mental disorder and who has failed before a lot because of panic attacks and a host of other things way worse than regular stress ill give you my advice. \n\n1) Do your best and dont burden yourself if you cannot handle it. Take less courses and do well in them is better than more and you do bad in all or mediocre.\n\n2) I read textbooks in the full and do suggested problems. If i see a teacher hasnt given problems i always ask them for it. There are videos, lectures, notes and you name it free online. Use these recources. Not everyone can do well with half ass lecture notes. I take intense lecture notes when i attend class but i never study them because i cant stand broken trains of thought. Textbook gives EVERYTHING in physics.\n\n3) Make a cheat sheet. I make a cheat sheet of every chapter formulas and review only that the day of exams.\n\n4) Go see a guidance counselor. Ask your options if it doesn't go well.\n\n5) Some courses have free tutoring. Research if there is for that course and go do it. Go to tutorials and stuff these are all there for you.\n\n6) Go to gradesavers or hire a private tutor. If you study and you see it doesnt work go get tutoring at gradesavers. They do reviews of almost all the courses\n\nlastly, do practice midterms and exams if you are short on time. If you can do those somewhat good you are at least going to be calmer in the exam than if you dont.\n\nTake it from me, ive seen all the faces of stress my whole life. You have to think positive and whatever happens if you have health and you are going to live on no matter what dont worry too much. Stress literally kills people. I hate these modest wannabee students sometimes who say they are stressed just to say it. Truly few know true stress and im telling you school aint worth it.

78,math 255 opinions,a4rc7j,5,"I took math 243 last year however did very poorly (got a C) due to a lack of focus and a general bad semester for me personally ( bc of shit mental health, drugs, sex and rock and roll. but mostly shit mental health and too many drugs). Anyway, given that McGill does not let students repeat courses I wanted to take math 255 to show to grad schools that I know analysis. My plan is to go to grad school for probability and as such analysis is very important. I was just wondering what your thoughts are on a majors math student taking math 255. I got an A- in math 242 with Hundemer. The only honours math class I have taken is math 248 with Guan in which I got a B (I worked my ass off for this class). 

Any input would greatly be appreciated. 

Im a math and comp scie major. Ill be taking math 447, comp 251, analysis maybe, and comp 273 next semester and maybe an elective comp scie course or no course at all ie only take 4 classes.","[""You can retake the course and it will appear on your transcript with your new grade. The new mark just won't count towards your GPA or credit total, and of course your first attempt will also remain on your transcript. \n\nHundemer is a pretty easy grader, so given your past performance, it might be better for you to retake that course than to risk doing poorly in a more difficult honours course. "", 'wot.... \nthats a game changer. \nThanks\nalso, Have you taken math 255, if so do you recommend it over retaking 243 given that I sort of have a basic idea of the content from 243? ', 'I haven\'t taken both, so I can\'t really compare the two streams directly, but personally I would just retake MATH 243. \n\nThe reason I say that is because in order to create the impression that analysis isn\'t a ""weak spot"" for you, you need to do disproportionally well in whichever course you decide to take. If you\'d normally be shooting for a B (an ""average"" grade, I don\'t know what your actual average is), then you need at least an A- in whichever course you take, especially since you\'d be familiar with the material either way. Getting a B on your second attempt wouldn\'t exactly help you. \n\nI know that, with the honours course, your mark could maybe afford to be a bit lower because it\'s harder, but it\'s still a second attempt in that you\'re going in having seen the material before. As such, it still needs to be higher than your ""average"" performance, so the lowest you could afford is maybe a B+. \n\nBetween an A- in MATH 243 and a B+ in MATH 255, I would definitely say that it\'s easier to do 5% better in a non-honours course. \n\nAlso consider the risk you\'re taking. Your chances of doing better in MATH 243 are pretty good. If, however, you take MATH 255 and don\'t do well (it\'s not inconceivable that you might do equally well or only slightly better), then you not only have a low grade in that course, which even on its own wouldn\'t be ideal for someone headed for grad school, but that grade would also effectively act as confirmation that the MATH 243 mark wasn\'t a fluke, and that it\'s actually a weak spot rather than a single bad grade. You will have established a trend. \n\nThe benefits of taking MATH 255 are:\n\n - If, hypothetically, you could do equally well in both courses, the honours level course would look better.\n\n - 3 credits and a small boost to your CGPA\n\nThe credits/GPA are negligible, especially if you\'re already in your third or fourth year, so the ""honours"" descriptor and a slightly higher tolerance for a lower grade it the only benefit. Given that you say you worked your ass off and got a B in the last honours course you took, and that your got a low grade in the non-honours equivalent, I honestly think it\'s too big a risk to take the honours course given the type of performance you need to demonstrate. \n\nYou could also do none of the above and take Analysis 3. It would be new material, so having seen it before wouldn\'t be held against you, it\'s not honours, so you have a better idea of what to expect, and it\'s just as good a way, if not a better way, to demonstrate that the Analysis 2 grade was a fluke, especially if you did pretty well in Analysis 1 and are pretty good at math courses in general. \n\nTL;DR: I think it would be better to retake MATH 243, if you\'re confident you can pull off a an ""above-average"" grade, or to take Analysis 3, if you think you can get an ""average"" grade. ', 'Ya that makes sense. Im not really chasing the GPA boost, its mostly about me showing to grad schools that I understand basic analysis. Im pretty confident that if I retook 243 I would get at least an A-, whereas if I took 255 I would probably at most get a B+ and thats if I study like a mad man which i am not sure will be feasible given my other classes are pretty demanding. \n\nThanks for the advice!', 'If you retake 243 and do well, you can also do Analysis 3 on top of that if you want. Doing well in both sends a pretty strong message. ']"

82,"Medical Residency Nightmare, How to Help ?",879vwc,33,"Hope this finds people able to help a fellow resident.

A resident within my program has been, over the last few years, a victim of severe bullying, rumor mongering and slander from within her residency program. 
This is not unusual at Mcgill and is usually part of the politics of the job to some degree: basically a lot of ' won't be the first, won't be the last' often happens to students who are a bit out of the 'clicks' that form within  residency cohorts. 
What is happening to her is, I have realized, due to a pair of residents in her program having a severe dislike of her and several of us have stood aside for fear of taking sides.
She is an exemplary resident, has not responded to any of the provocation and I have worked with her on call, no disciplinary issues, loved by several if not all staffs. Great evaluations but I can see the toll that this is starting to take on her and am afraid for her well being and mental health.

After what recently happened within the dentistry program and the current atmosphere around campus with other cases I'm motivated to speak out on her behalf and ask for advice from those on this subreddit who have experienced similar scenarios or who have witnessed such cases getting addressed and resolved so I can find the tools to help her.

Thanks and God Bless.

87,Where to go from a BSc in Biology with an interest in Computer Science?,8yoytm,4,"I graduated from McGill with a BSc in Biology last year and I have been having a really hard time finding a job in the field. I worked for 3 months in a neurosciences lab as a research assistant but got laid off because of lack of relevant experience. The problem is that my interests in Biology are more on the fundamental research side i.e. in the fields of Evolution, Development and Ecology, which also happen to be the fields that receive the least funding. I have been considering doing a Masters degree in one of those fields but I am not quite sure research in one of those fields is a good fit for me long term considering the few job opportunities and the potential negative effects of research on my mental health. This explains pretty well why I decided to take a year off to give me time to think.

I have recently discovered an interest for Computer Science which I started to learn more about as I studied on my own the material from COMP 202, and I am planning to study most of the 200 level courses on my own.

I regret not having completed a double major during my undergrad and I would like to gain expertise in a new field as to expand my options. I would like to learn more about CS and I considered going into a Masters in Bioinformatics as one of my options. After talking to two different professors that do bioinformatics, I understood it might not be a good idea to do a Masters in Bioinformatics without a background in CS.

I have considered going back for a second Bachelor in CS at McGill but it turns out I am not eligible for any of the faculties offering the program: my GPA is too low and prerequisites consist of differential and integral calculus (I had exemptions for MATH 140 and 141 coming in my first degree and am unsure whether that is enough). I went to admissions to get more information and they seemed to say that the admission requirements are pretty strict for transfer and second degree students because of the few spots available. Does anyone here have any firsthand experience, or know someone that has, on getting accepted for a second degree with an unsatisfactory GPA?

I have also considered a Bachelor in CS at Concordia and UdeM but the prerequisites remain an issue I need to sort out. It might have to take some extra math courses if I want to go forth with that idea. I would prefer doing this degree at McGil as I could do a joint major in CS and Bio and reuse credits from my first degree for as much as one third of the credits for the program.

The last option I can think of at the moment is doing a bootcamp and later landing a job at a tech company to learn more about CS in a practical way. However, my understanding is that I would learn more about programming and not that much about the theoretical aspects of CS. Is it possible to go into a Thesis Masters in CS after a bootcamp and relevant work experience?

While doing a second Bachelor in CS seems that it would give me the most options in the future, I would appreciate your feedback on all the options I presented here including the Masters in Bioinformatics or the bootcamp route. I would also welcome other alternative ideas and I thank you for reading this far!","[""Yeah unfortunately a background in Biology does not really help you with bioinformatics. I am currently finishing my masters at McGill in computational biology (in CS) after an undergrad in CS & Bio and tbh I have not once used something I learned in biology in my research so far, and constantly find myself wishing I had done more math. \nFor the masters in CS, McGill requires you to have completed the equivalent of at least a minor in CS, and you need a decent GPA and decent letters of recommendation preferably from academia, so if your GPA is poor and you don't have research experience this looks like a dead end without a second degree.\n\nYou could do your second bachelors in CS from Arts, which is just as good as CS in Science and should be easier to get admitted to."", 'You can do a BA in CS at McGill. It\'s basically the exact same if you take the supplementary CS minor. You don\'t need any prereqs for the BA.\n\nGrades are still an issue though. Even for a BA, second degree applicants need high GPAs. Depends on the year but below a 3.5 probably means no dice. \n\nYou definitely couldn\'t do a joint major in Bio and CS at McGill anyway. Your previous BSc bio would preclude you from too many courses. It also doesn\'t make sense. You would just get a BSc Bio + BSc/BA CS in the end so why make the second a joint degree?\n\nMcGill requires you to take 60 credits in order to get a degree. If you have a degree already, that means taking just 2 years of courses. You obviously still need to complete the program requirements but a CS degree would be 60 credits anyway so that means a perfectly succinct 2 years. \n\nOther schools probably have similar regulations but you would need to get recognition for your transfer credits. (As in, the degree is still 120 credits, but at McGill they would just take your past degree as 60 credits of complementaries and that would just leave the 60 required credits from the program).\n\nBootcamps aren\'t really given much credit in most domains. They can help you to become a code monkey but that\'s about it. You can learn CS theory on your own but it will be harder to get a foot in the door to something interesting.\n\nI see two reasonable options (there are probably more, this is just my POV). You could take a second CS degree at another school if McGill\'s entrance requirements are too steep (GPA is king and they don\'t make concessions). Hopefully you could get enough transfer credits to complete the program in 2 years as you would at McGill. Alternatively, you could register as an independent student and take a few CS courses per semester. Most CS-related masters programs require an approximation of a CS minor (around 8 courses in CS). Every school has its own restrictions. I believe McGill requires specific CS courses whereas UofT just wants a ""strong minor in CS"" or some-such. There are probably restrictions and limitations I\'m not aware of, but this is definitely a potential avenue.\n\nEdit: I should add that many universities do **not** see a bootcamp as equivalent to university coursework. For a masters program, it would probably be a waste of time.', 'Hey, if you want to look into a Comp2-- level class related to Biology, I suggest you to take or check Comp204 computer programming for life sciences. I have a buddy who has taken it and is now working with a prof doing bioinformatics research. Maybe that could be a start. As for bootcamps, according to the little things I know about them... I would stay away from them since your goal is more research oriented/theoretical and bootcamps tend to be a lot more practical.\n\nHopefully, what you could do is to take comp204 and learn other CS class over the internet, like mit opencourseware, stanford CS class or even EdX. Online resources for CS are plenty and sufficient for you to become really good. With some research and asking around, you could tailor your own bio oriented CS education. What is hard is to motivate yourself to do them. So i dont know if it s the best idea.', ""COMP 204 is more designed for people who don't plan on doing further CS. If someone is planning on doing a CS degree or taking an equivalent to COMP 250, 202 is just a better course to take.\n\n204 is a nice general interest course but it does not really teach you the formalism that you will need in further courses.\n""]"
88,Anyone ever appealed to a Faculty Dean for a rewrite?,8fhdfn,9,"I'm in a rather unusual situation. I was diagnosed with bipolar a short time ago, and it completely messed up my exams this semester. I went into a depressive ""phase"" right before my exams and I was pretty much paralyzed by it until I went to urgent care at psychiatry and they gave me more meds. 

The problem is that I actually wrote two of my exams - I wasn't exactly in a position to recognize that I was completely and utterly unable to sit an exam. I had self-medicated with alcohol AND sleeping pills AND stimulants, and went to those exams in that state (not drunk or anything, just woefully unable to perform remotely well). 

For my first exam, I basically just wrote down what I knew and filled in the rest without putting in the effort that a person normally would to remember something I wasn't sure about (it was a memorization-based course). I know I passed, but I also know that I didn't get an A as I most likely would have otherwise. 

My second exam was WAAAY worse. I went in, as I said, pretty much paralyzed. I don't know if it was anxiety or the bipolar or whatever else, but I was obsessed with doing each individual question perfectly. I made sure to write neatly and actually got mad when something wasn't neat enough, and I wrote my rationale in the sidelines for everything. For the MC, for some reason I decided to solve each question multiple times in every way I could think of, but I couldn't process any of what I as reading, so it took several tries to get through what would normally have been a 30 second problem-solving process. 

I also spent substantial amounts of time just sort of staring at my exam. I felt so caught between extreme anxiety and a lack of willpower to do anything. Even filling in my scantron seemed like a huge obstacle. With about an hour left reality kicked in and I realized that I would probably fail (I was pretty confident in my ability to get an A a week before this exam), and so I just told them I wanted to leave. 

They didn't really want to let me leave, so they made me sit down with an advisor, at which point I had something that could only be described as a complete meltdown. I basically just sat there sobbing and talking about random shit that I can't even remember for two hours, at which point the advisor said I should just go finish my exam, so I went in and wrote something down, bubbled in answers that ""looked nice"" for my MC, and left. 

I didn't even tell the psychiatrists how severe my symptoms were, mostly because I was so embarrassed about my complete lack of ability to control my mood. In retrospect, that was probably a mistake and would have helped my appeal. 

In any case, I applied to defer the rest of my exams, withdraw from one to reduce my workload, and I'm going to try to appeal to the Faculty Dean for an opportunity to rewrite the exam. 

----------

I have no idea how to approach this. Should I be completely honest and tell her the entire messy story? Should I make it concise, quick, and logical? Should I talk about the impact it will have on my studies? I feel like this basically comes down to whether this dean is sympathetic towards mental health issues or is one of those people who thinks that it's often used as an excuse or exaggerated. 

If I don't get this, I will need to switch universities in order to pursue the program I want (if anyone would even accept me) or pick a different program, and it would take my current 3.9 GPA down substantially. 

If anyone has appealed something for any reason, I'd appreciate any suggestions. Or if anyone else has any thoughts or suggestions I'm open to hearing those too. 

TL;DR: I attempted to write exams even though I was not in the right state of mind to do so, now I'm appealing to the Dean for a rewrite. 

Edit: MAN that's a huge wall of text. Sorry :(","['I actually had a very similar situation last winter: my bipolar wasn\'t newly diagnosed but it was newly medicated. One of my meds was being overprescribed, and I got launched into a depressive episode on top of having gotten a concussion right before exams. I failed two exams for classes that should\'ve been easy As for me. When I spoke to the professors about it, they told me there was nothing they could do because I passed the courses. I didn\'t escalate it to the dean because I mean....I was not doing well and a pass was good enough for me at that point, so I can\'t say if that would have helped. One of the profs was tremendously understanding though and reorganized my grade a bit, dropping weight from a midterm I wrote literally right after leaving the psych ward that I didn\'t actually think defer, etc.\n\nI\'m sure this isn\'t really what you want to hear, but keep in mind one (or two) bad grades isn\'t everything. I went from high 3s to low-mid 3s after that semester, and immediately boosted myself back up during the summer semester. I was accepted to my inter-faculty transfers last summer (granted I did have to suck it up and explain my situation in the lil box about extenuating circumstances) and even a ""prestigious"" research position this summer. Obviously I don\'t know your exact situation, but one bad semester (even for me when mine was half my GPA at that point) almost certainly won\'t ruin your chances of doing whatever it is you want to do. \n\nEdit: if you\'re concerned about the dean or whoever else understanding the validity of bipolar, feel free to message me to talk about it; I\'ve had the lovely experience of convincing more middle aged men in academia that Yes My Brain Really Works Like This Thanks than I ever would have wanted to.', '[deleted]', ""Once it's written, it's over.

But even if they can't change anything, know that one or two bad grades won't completely derail your life (even though it might feel that way especially since you seem like a high achiever). Yes, it might mean the difference between getting into a particular program or not, but don't think that all hope is lost. There will always be something that you can do.

89,Should I drop out?,7rride,23,"Im a sophmore in second semester but my depression has taken a toll for the worst. I cant think straight, my grades last semester were shit again because of my mental health. 

I need to do well this semester or I cant transfer into compsci my gpa is at an all time low. I have no friends and burned too many bridges because I'm an idiot.

Basically I havent had a good time here just in general and everyday just gets harder and harder to get through. ","['Hey, I\'m in a similar situation. Everyone is different and not everyone can be healed the same way, but I\'ll tell you what\'s worked for me.\n \n-Try to be alone as little as possible. For me I found that my sadness and bad thoughts got the worst whenever I was alone. Whenever you find yourself sitting at home alone and feel sad or lonely, you should get out of the house and go to a cafe or something and just chill there. It\'s just nice to be around others and it can make you feel less lonely.\n\n-Take a lighter courseload this semester. If you\'ve been taking 5 classes, drop down to 4, maybe take a bird course. You should go easy on yourself this semester and hopefully raise your confidence. Which will make all the difference in the world. Side note: I don\'t know what you want to do in life, but I\'m in the comp sci field and have never been asked my GPA by employers.\n\n-Think about reaching out to some acquaintances from Rez who you could see a friendship with. Just a quick facebook message like ""Johnny! How have you been man?"" \n\n-Join a club. Reach out to the CSUS to meet people in your program; maybe even join a fraternity/sorority if that\'s what you\'re into. These are all really great ways to get involved on campus, meet people and make friendships that will stick, make the McGill community feel smaller and less overwhelming, etc. \n\nGood luck, I really hope things will get better. Don\'t hesitate to PM me if you want to talk. \n\nEdit: I forgot to address your original question. No, you shouldn\'t drop out. There\'s still time to raise your GPA and turn your life around. A lot of 4th years say that 2nd year was the worst for them and then things got much better. ', 'I graduated a year ago, but most of my years at McGill were hell for the same reason. My best suggestion is to reduce your course load, make sure to take 1 or 2 summer classes (take one in June, another in August...) if you want to graduate within a reasonable amount of time, and please please please seek therapy if you get random suicidal thoughts. One of my friends had a tough time at McGill as well, then she transferred to Concordia and finished her compsci degree. She’s currently happy and working in the field. I’m headed to grad school this year. \n\nAll of that to say there’s a way out of this hell hole. Slow down, seek help, change if you need to.

You're just setting yourself up for an awesome comeback story :) "", ""Unfollow everything on Facebook and I'd recommend not using instagram. "", 'To add on to that post (I\'m just coming out of the phase that you\'re describing):\n\n\n - Pick something and pursue it, no matter what it is. Often you start to pull away from other activities in your life when you\'re going through a stressful time (or at least I do). It\'s kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy because you feel like your life sucks and you\'re going nowhere, and as a result you get depressed and you *do* stop making progress. \n\nTry to pick something low/medium-risk i.e. something that you know you can reasonably accomplish (but still need to put effort into) rather than something far fetched. It can be anything from improving your Rubik\'s Cube solving skills to getting an A in a particular course to spending time on your artwork, but it should have an **end goal** rather than being a continuous pursuit. That will stop the cycle of feeling ""stuck"" and will make you feel like you\'re going somewhere and are capable of moving forward. \n\nIf you\'re the type of person who likes to do this, get one of those big desk calendars and have daily goals and plan ahead by a month or two. For example, you can write down a section in your textbook to do every second day (it doesn\'t have to be academic though). You\'ll feel like you\'re constantly accomplishing things, even get ""ahead"", and you can visually see it and physically cross things off as you do them. \n\n\n - Take four courses, or less if being a part-time student won\'t affect you in any way, and pick courses that are relatively easy, but also interesting. Calculate your TGPA from last semester and just try to beat that. Don\'t expect straight-As - pick a realistic goal. So, for example, if your TGPA was 2.0 last semester (about a C in each course), maybe aim for a B average and at least a C+ in each course. You can always adjust your goals if they\'re too easy/hard. \n\n\n - Psychologically, and I didn\'t realize this until after the fact, but just being around *life forms* helps. If you don\'t feel like socializing, do anything else that will trick your brain into thinking that you are. I, for example, love going to Tim Hortons to study. Just being in an environment with people will keep you from shutting yourself out. Alternatively, if you don\'t want to leave home, just have the TV or the radio on in the background, go see those therapy dogs when they come to class, or even buy a freaking houseplant and take care of it.  \n\n\n - Talk to somebody. I know a lot of people give the advice of ""talking to a friend"" (and definitely do that if it works for you), but I personally didn\'t really have any close friends at the time and the thought of ""opening up"" to someone I didn\'t really know that well didn\'t appeal. \n\nI found it most helpful to talk to either a) someone anonymous or b) someone I was never going to see again. The internet is great for this. You can find entire subs dedicated to depression, mourning, academic stress, etc. If you\'re more of a 1-on-1 type of person, you can PM me  (I don\'t associate my account with my real identity) and discuss whatever\'s on your mind at the given time.  You could also use services such as the Nightline, which is also anonymous, if you\'re comfortable talking over the phone.\n\nIf you feel as though telling someone what your goals are will make them more concrete in your mind, then do that too. \n\n\n - Do therapy of whatever sort you\'re comfortable with. Counselling is the route that people will recommend to you most often, and if that\'s something you\'d be willing to try out i would recommend it. I tried that, but the first counsellor I saw was... well, she sucked at her job, so I didn\'t pursue it further, but I tried it again a year later, and the second time I had a much better experience. They can also tell you whether they think pursuing medication is a good idea in your case and give you professional advice on things that other people, although well intended, might not be qualified to speak on. \n\nIf you don\'t want to do that right now, then keep it as an option for later, or if you\'re not sure, then go once and see how it goes. You\'re not obligated to show up a second time if you don\'t want to. \n\n\n - Try not to get into any bad habits that will make your situation *worse*. I made that mistake myself, and it **really** crept up on me fast because I\'ve always been more on the goodie-two-shoes side and I never thought I would react the way I did, and I really didn\'t recognize myself or feel like I knew who I was after the fact. I had abandoned some previously healthy relationship in my life, given up goals, and done some... questionably smart things that I won\'t detail on a public forum. In retrospect, I would have tried to avoid this, hence my suggestion to you. \n\nIf you notice yourself eating junk food all the time, getting into drugs, becoming risk-prone, or whatever it may be, try to pick activities that aren\'t going to hurt you in the long run. For example, activities that give you an adrenaline rush flood your brain with a ""happy hormone"" and make you feel euphoric, so if you\'re out looking for that, then ride a roller coaster, go skydiving, or do whatever the hell it is you need to do, but try your hardest to avoid things that you know you\'ll end up kicking yourself for. \n\n\nI can\'t think of anything else right now (I\'m trying to go back in my mind and remember some of the things that I struggled with), but if I do think of something that I missed I\'ll edit. If you think I missed something, you can reply and I\'ll address it if I can. \n\nOh and to actually answer the **question in the title**: don\'t drop out right away, see how it goes with an easier workload and withdraw late if you really need to. **Trust your gut** over anything that anyone else says to you. Either way, take some time to recover over the summer. I went travelling for three months, so if you think that might get you out of your slump...

They\'re helpful any time that you don\'t have anyone in your life that can relate to or is knowledgeable about what you\'re going through. That can be anything from learning to play piano to losing weight to travelling. \n\nOP mentioned that he/she doesn\'t really have any friends. Having been there and done that, I can personally attest that online communities were very helpful to me not only as a place to rant, but as a place to exchange ideas and opinions. \n\nA big part of the reason why we value friends is because we can bounce things off of them. Should I go out with so-and-so? I have a problem with another person, what should I do? Do you think I was right to do this-and-that? How do you think I could best accomplish X? \n\nWhile I am most certainly not saying that the internet can replace friendships, it can help bridge gaps and can act as a resources or direct you towards resources that can *prevent you from getting to the point where self-harm becomes a concern in the first place*. \n\n> Otherwise, you\'re probably gonna end up in endless co-rumination which will only strengthen negative feelings.\n\nI\'ve thought about this as well, and I agree that only spending time on those specific forums can have adverse effects when done in excess. \n\nHowever, there is a flip side, and that\'s all of the other communities and the environment and mentality that they endorse. There are equally many communities that focus on motivation, goal setting, improving one\'s mental/physical/social health, exercising, academics, you name it. \n\nSomeone who has little outside social support would benefit greatly because ultimately, many people get depressed *because they\'re not accomplishing anything or moving forward*. \n\nOP sounds like the type of person who is in the initial stages of developing depression, and the most powerful way to combat that in my experience has been to set goals and do something that helps you move forward, or at least makes you feel as though you are. \n\nFor example, one o my goals in the past was weight loss, and having no social support at the time, I relied heavily on an online community for both the **practical knowledge/advice** and the **motivation and mindset** I needed to get there, as well as the odd visit to self-improvement/goal-setting type communities. \n\nSO while I agree that just hanging around other depressed people isn\'t the best way to go, I do think that in moderation they can be very helpful and that in combination with other communities, the internet (reddit in particular) can go a long way towards mitigating the effects of ""low points"" in a person\'s life, as OP is describing. \n\n> u/_lifesucks_ I can see you\'re already doing this, and I highly advise that you try to at least find another healthier mechanism to deal with this issue.\n\nTo add on to that, in case my initial post wasn\'t clear, find both a variety of online communities, if you decide to do that, and try the other things I mentioned (goal setting, the calendar, counselling). In time, your gut will point you towards the combination that works best for you. \n\n>  /r/aww is a good catch-all,\n\nCute puppy pictures are actually a really great idea (which is why I suggested therapy dogs as well) because interacting with animals releases ""happy hormones"", notably oxytocin, which can make you feel happy (duh) and also relieve stress. This is true for everyone, but especially women. That\'s not meant to suggest that men don\'t have parental/nurturing instincts, but for women it\'s particularly strong because the release of oxytocin in response to an infant triggers the production/release of breast milk (along with prolactin and other hormones), so our survival as a species kinda depends on that response, and it extends to animals as well (this is for both sexes, men can actually produce breast milk with the help of prolactin injections). ;) \n\n/u/wonderlaend, feel free to disagree if you\'d like. At the end of the day, this is advice for OP, so disagreement never hurts. \n\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot to mention, ""internet"" doesn\'t mean ""Facebook"". I\'d suggest keeping social media accounts, but deleting the apps/shortcuts and not using it except to get in touch with someone or for 1-on-1 messaging. I\'ve never really used Facebook or any other social media platform, and I can\'t say I feel like I\'m missing out at all. ', 'Ah. Have you considered taking fewer classes (I think you have to report it to the FA office) and/or pass/fail courses and/or easier courses this semester?

They also often mention things such as selfharm, suicide, and substance abuse, and such concepts become normalized in the culture of those subs. Asking questions is good, like ""How did you guys get through this?"", but reading about people attempting suicide every day is just not. In fact, people are more likely to attempt suicide after seeing / hearing about someone else who did it.

90,Putting McGill hate in context,87cq7w,9,"I hear/see a lot of McGill hate nowadays, and most of it is really fair criticism of the institution. However, I do think that it's rarely acknowledged that we aren't the only university with some of these serious issues.

I'd consider myself a big try hard (always have been) and being here for a few years now I've found that I'm just really tired and worn out trying to get a high GPA.

Your mind needs something to tie your self worth to, and if it has nothing else, it puts all of the eggs in the GPA basket. Therefore, in order to lower your expectations, you need to ""spread out"" your self worth so that you aren\'t relying solely on your grades. This can come from anything: playing an instrument, developing a relationship, you name it. \n\nSince most McGill students work really well within the academic grading system, yourself most likely included, I would suggest pursuing something that has a really structured assessment format. \n\nFor example, let\'s say you learn to play the piano. You can do RCM exams, which are structured much in the same way school exams would be. By pursuing that hobby, you\'d give your mind something else to lean on other than your grades. \n\nOf course it doesn\'t need to be an instrument, but you get my drift.

94,Complaining about exams frequently will lead to unhappiness,7kwrwc,11,"I hope my opinion doesn't generate controversy and instead raises awareness on how regularly complaining about the challenges we encounter in life will harm you and also the people surrounding you, and the importance of grounding yourself in mental discipline and keeping a positive outlook on life. 

I truly believe mental health is crucial, and anyone going through a tough period I can empathize in full, and I think its complete bullshit to just tell people to “distress” and “just think positively” - if anxiety and depression could be combatted so simply they wouldn’t be the large-scale problems they are today.

I do think, however, that too many people nowadays channel their negative emotions in an unconstructive manner, resorting to venting their frustration on social media: on Facebook posts, Instagram stories and snaps. Whether by lashing out on profs who they feel have wronged them, complaining about an exam they aren’t prepared to face, etc. During this time the topics of conversation with range from final exams, to lab reports and papers to submit, leaving no time to take a break from the constant bombarding of work to do. 

But will this really help you? Will the likes you receive and the superficial validation of your feelings of dread address those feelings, and lead to a stronger sense of ease? Constantly complaining about your stress, rather than talking and discussing about it will only continue a cycle of negativity that will affect everyone around you.

We enjoy so much talking outwardly about our stress, rather than addressing our stress nowadays. We never give ourselves a break to ourselves, and neglect a crucial aspect of personal well-being: that you start addressing it from within.

There are steps that people can take to increase their well-being, and sometimes they don't realize those outlets exist. Taking breaks or going out for walks, and studying responsibly throughout the semester are things that just don't seem that common anymore. 

I think everyone deserves to be happy. Sadly, not everyone has the right tools set in place to take care of themselves. 


","[""Yo, what else are you supposed to do when you get back a final that's 40% when you thought you got at least 75%? Just sleep?\n\nI can guarantee you if it wasn't all the complaining, I'd be nuts a loooooong time ago. It's a way of letting your emotions go away, and works especially well when you got a friend who also needs to complain. If you don't let it out, well, it builds up the invisible pressure that WILL destroy you eventually. \n\nMost of the time we DONT need to talk and discuss about it because we all know the solution (i.e. study more or find the prof and argue), all we need is just to let it out and complain, nothing more, also because none of the people you talk to can help you(unless they do the exam for you, in that case, I'm calling the police). Don't put yourself above others as if all you need is serious discussion and never complain, we are all just normal humans, we need an outlet so we can be sane. \n\nIt's just the tough times, we all know it, you virtually can't make someone happy when they got 6 finals and 2 papers (look at this dumb ass who decided to take 6 courses) over a week of time. When the break comes, everyone will calm their shit down and hopefully be happy."", '/r/wowthanksimcured', 'This post cured my hygiene de vie', '>Complaining about exams frequently will lead to unhappiness\n\nI think TAKING  exams frequently lead to my unhappiness in the first place.....', '[deleted]', 'Living in constant negativity will lead to unhappiness. Thinking that you\'ll fail, saying that you\'ll fail, will lead you to believe that you\'ll fail, thus you\'ll act like you\'re going to fail, and achieve failure. It\'s a self-fulfilling prophecy and a vicious cycle as a lie said enough times eventually becomes the truth. So many people are unable to get these negative thoughts out of their heads and that\'s what, in part, leads to these academic issues. \n\nYou aren\'t wrong in saying that we need to address our stress in constructive manners, go take a walk, do exercise, do something ELSE than worry. You\'re right, it\'s not hard and will most definitely help people like myself who have no real mental health issue. I\'m just a student who does slightly more than the minimum required to stay on top of my classes and do okay. In the end, it bites me in the ass as I have to cram for all my finals and essentially REALLY learn the course material for several classes in perhaps two weeks or less (I\'m being very generous on time here).\n\nFor a lot of us, we complain because it\'s the most time efficient way of venting and coping with our situations. You have to look at the root cause of an issue in order to resolve it, not just try to fix the symptoms. The reason why so many people complain all the time is because there isn\'t time in these last few weeks to do much else. \n\nFor the last two weeks I\'ve been getting up at 8:00~8:30, eating a little, studying until lunch, having a quick lunch, studying (at this point it\'s not too too efficient but fuck it caffeine helps), maybe eating supper, studying some more until around 9:30-10PM, entertaining myself until midnight or so, sleep and rinse-repeat. Fortunately for me, this works without being too damaging to my sanity as I learnt over my brief years at McGill what really matters (sleep). For others, this might not be the case and they cram only a day before, don\'t sleep, don\'t eat , and so on, which can be extremely taxing. Do they have time for typical life hygiene management? Eh, probably not and that\'s understandable, they don\'t want to fail. For a student without much real world perspective failing a class is the worst thing that\'s ever happened to them, and until they understand that failure happens and that it\'s not the end of the world, shit won\'t change. \n\nOn the other hand, they should just study all semester long and avoid this situation, right? Yes, again, not wrong, but sometimes the situation doesn\'t really permit it. A lot of people are detached from the reality students face at McGill, one recent example is our current deputy provost. ""Don\'t cram a week before your exam!"", for some classes, I wish I had a whole week. Instead I\'m learning new things in that class on Thursday the 7th of December and my final is on Friday the 8th. Neat. \n\nDifferent programs have different requirements and different people have different needs and what really bothers me in these kind of ""just take care lul"" messages shows a complete lack of understanding and makes me almost believe it\'s willful ignorance. In the end, the only thing that makes it easier for me is ranting and complaining with others who suffer through the same hardships as myself. Venting with friends and classmates is the only reason why I\'m still in my program tbh. We\'ve built such a nice sense of community by bonding over our common hardships. \n\nDoes complaining lead to unhappiness? I don\'t think so, living negatively and unhappily does, complaining is one of the things making me remember that grades aren\'t all that matter and when I\'m done, those grades I got won\'t really matter down the road. Also, this large rant has essentially reduced my stress and I can probably get back to studying now. \n\nBest of luck, don\'t take shit too seriously, and kick ass guys.\n\nTL;DR: SLEEP & RANT MOTHERFUCKERS, IT\'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANYTHING FOR YOUR SANITY.', 'WOW IT REALLY JUST NEVER OCCURRED TO ME TO STUDY RSPONSIBLITY THROUGHOUT THE SEMESTER THANKS', 'But how ELSE will I burn time during final season?

Of course, I think its extremely important to take care of negative emotions that well up, and I dont wish to offend people by just telling them not to complain about their problems. But I believe there are much stronger ways that will let you compose yourself mentally that are so much more effective than that.  \n\nMeditation, working out, reading, running, goal setting, etc are all things you can do that are so many times more effective than just venting out.

96,"When to see a therapist, etc",7y1gtl,9,"Hey, I read all the stuff in the side bar about mental health resources but I'm still having a hard time figuring out what exactly I should do.

I *feel* like I should try to get a therapist, but I'm not 100% sure if that's the right thing. I've been looking online and on the counselling website and but I'm not sure what exactly I should do?

Uhhh anyway, idk what to do?

98,"Suzanne Fortier must step up, or step down!",79xejv,17,"I hate to break the truth to everyone, but the reality is, Professor Fortier has not been doing a capable job. It's very simple, for a world class university, its goals should primarily be 1) to train the students to become the best of the world, 2) to do research that are the best in the world, and 3) to satisfy the students' and employees need by bringing order to campus.

Fortier has failed in all of them. Our best professors are leaving to other universities or companies at an ever increasing rate. We are not getting enough money from ANYWHERE to support the research, I mean, since Fortier took the place, our ranking has fallen SO MUCH - remember the way up the rank is much much harder than going down, especially considering we are losing some of the most talented professors. You can say 'oh the government cut our funding', but a CAPABLE principal will not brag about the smoll 10m$ she got from some random place and just sit here but will try everything they can to get much much more, in fact I'm fairly certain if it was a capable person knowing how politics works, the budget cut might have never been this severe. Besides, we are NOT recognizing that we're falling behind, we just close our eyes and imagine 'oh we are still the number 1 on this maclean's university rankings and I cant see that we've fallen to the 60s on some other rankings' - slowly and slowly the talented postdocs will choose to become a prof somewhere else rather than McGill, and we'd be losing some great prospective students too, especially since our international student fee is also rising. Our student lives, lol, it has been going nowhere - never considered the mental health need of a fall break when even UdeM has it now, not mentioning the bad mental health/clinic service or the SSMU drama.

Look, there should be no choice. Fortier MUST step up or step down. She needs to use whatever ways she can to maximize the fundings, to get students to enjoy rather suffer here, and provide much more attractive opporunities to both students and professors, such as actually functioning incubators i.e. more commericialization opportunities for research results.

As someone who's seen behind the scenes as a senator, number *ARE NOT EVERYTHING* when it comes to rankings and you need to read the methodology before making assumptions. one good way to look at this is the consistency between rankings at MacLeans and the difference between QS and THE when there was a split (i forget it was QS with THE or ARWU with THE), but the methodology changed when they split leading to McGill falling because they ranked less favourably. \n\nMoreover everything burgleurgle has said is spot on with regards to research income and (such). My one disagreement is Suzanne's handling of Student Affairs (with regards to SSMU last year), she had no right to threaten to withhold funding under Quebec laws, however, should she not have intervened in that manner i think SSMU would be in a very different position, and I believe her approach to the recent fall situation has been very respectable. Also her approach to the resignation of Andrew Potter is leaving a lot of Faculty questioning her leadership which should be questioned ."", '> her approach to the resignation of Andrew Potter is leaving a lot of Faculty questioning her leadership\n\nWhy is that?']"
99,IAMA Candidate for Arts Senator in the upcoming AUS election - AMA!,7yzbd5,4,"My name is Anisah Shah and I'm a third year English Lit and Poli Sci student. I love Reddit and have found this subreddit super useful during my time at McGill, so I figured it's only fair to talk to everyone here about my campaign!

Feel free to Ask Me Anything you like about my campaign (or even just the Senate in general) and give suggestions for things you want to see from your representatives. 

If you want to speak to me privately, you can also send me a message here, reach me on Facebook, or send an email to me at anisah.shah@mail.mcgill.ca.

Here's the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1981145755260238/) for my campaign, but in case facebook isn't your speed I've copy pasted the text from my campaign here:

> ""Hi I’m Anisah, a third-year English and PoliSci student. 

> I’m running for Arts Senator to improve communication between students and the administration, and to advocate for issues related to student mental health through policy development and open conversation. 

> I specifically want to equip professors with the resources to help students with mental health issues. As an employee of a multi-national corporation as well as VP Communications for DESA McGill, I have experience in both outreach and professional negotiation. 

> I’m also a proud member of the nation’s only youth-led mental health organization, Jack.org, where I am continuously sharpening my approach to advocacy. 

> We've all read the response from the Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) and how that reflects on the attitudes of the administration. Students deserve to be represented by someone who will make sure administration will listen to the very real problems we face.

> If elected Senator, I will make it my primary goal to improve the accommodations policies surrounding course work to allow for a systematic way in which students suffering from mental health problems can take the time they need to get help and improve their health without worrying about penalties. By formalizing the process, there will be no room for professors who ""don't believe"" in offering extensions without doctors notes. 

> Many of us have been in a spot where we can't even leave the house to get a doctor's note to serve as adequate proof of illness (and if a student isn't regularly followed by a psychologist/psychiatrist, it's nigh on impossible to see anyone unless it is a pressing emergency).

> Students with mental health problems deserve an equal chance to succeed, but the University doesn't always allow for them to do so. In tandem with changing policy, I believe it's also important to make faculty aware of the problems students face, and offer ample information and resources to ensure they understand how they can help, when external resources may be required, and what constitutes a legitimate excuse. 

> Let’s spread awareness and hold the administration accountable to the students they serve.

> All you have to do to vote is click right [here!](https://ssmu.simplyvoting.com/index.php)

> Polling starts February 22nd at 9am.""

I'll be answering questions from now until the end of the polling period (March 1st @ 5pm) so don't feel pressured to think of something super witty immediately ;)
","[""Hey Anisah! I have a broad question - often, students aren't really taken seriously at Senate. How should Senate caucus members use their position there to advocate for students as efficiently as possible? How should Senators make the most of the power they have in that particular decision-making space?"", 'Hey! Great question.\n\nFirstly, we always need to remember that *everyone* in that room is a senator, a faculty member has the same voting power as a student, so keeping that in mind helps. If a prof or anyone tries to talk over a student, we have to (politely) remind them that we are talking and to let us finish. Being firm and confident is *absolutely* crucial. \n\nSecondly, finding allies within the faculty who are not blindly siding with admin is also a good way to ensure students are heard. Being open to collaborating with faculty is a great way to give projects some legs and legitimacy. \n\nLastly, maximizing the amount of engagement in committee work is important because the environment is much more conducive to discussion.\n\nI hope that answered your question!\n\n', 'Absolutely, thanks for the thorough answer!']"
